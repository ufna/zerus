"""Real Claude Code and Codex in the Windows session host, keyless (spec M7).

Windows only. HGS_TEST_BIN names the hgs.exe under test (the release build in CI);
HGS_CLAUDE_TEST_BIN and HGS_CODEX_TEST_BIN name the native executables taken from the
pinned win32-x64 npm packages (scripts/ci/agent-compatibility.json), and
HGS_TEST_CONPTY_DIR, when set, the pinned ConPTY pair that the portable zip ships
(scripts/fetch-conpty.py). A class skips only off Windows or without its executable or
HGS_TEST_BIN: scripts/ci/agent-compatibility.py counts a skip as a failure, and a
skipped native suite is no compatibility evidence. Whatever the agents do wrong is a
failure, never a skip.

Each case enables local sessions in a temporary profile as tests/test_windows_lifecycle.py
does: `hgs session-host install`, run from a portable copy of the build (beside the ConPTY
pair when given, as in the zip), stages the stable CLI, a host image and the marker there,
and the first launch starts the host from that image. The agent's executable is linked
into the profile's `.local\\bin`, which hgs puts first on PATH (src/platform/windows.rs
`prepare_path`; agents are found on that PATH, src/state/backend/host.rs), so only that
copy runs. Its home (CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, CODEX_HOME), where hgs installs its hooks (spec
D12), is the case's own, as are APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA and TEMP; Codex still resolves
`~` to the real profile (FOLDERID_Profile), see `project_parent`. The agents reach only
tests/model_api_fixture.py on 127.0.0.1, run with `python -I -X utf8`, with a dummy key;
any other HTTP(S) request goes to a dead local proxy, and updates, telemetry and other
nonessential traffic are off. Codex runs with full access and no approvals, as in spike
S6, so it never needs its Windows sandbox; the CI job never extracts the sandbox setup
program, and Codex never runs it.

Sessions are driven only through hgs, as the GUI drives them: a tracked launch,
`ls --json`, `inspect`, `send --json`, `answer --json`, `clear-context --json`, `pause`,
`resume -d` and `terminate`. What an agent accepted is read from its own transcript,
which hgs never writes. Each case covers one area for one agent:

- launch: the tracked launch reaches the composer, its hooks confirm the conversation in
  the listing, `inspect` and the journal; `hgs send` delivers a plain, a non-ASCII, a
  backslash-terminated and a multiline message, each exactly once, and a replayed
  request delivers nothing.
- question: the fake model asks (Claude's AskUserQuestion, Codex's
  request_user_input_async) and `hgs answer` answers from Activity.
- approval: Claude's Write permission prompt, and Codex's review of the hooks hgs
  installed, answered with `hgs answer`.
- answer channel (Claude): the PermissionRequest hook hgs registers in exec form takes
  the question's answers and Bash approvals (once, feedback, No), a Bash panel too tall
  for the host's 80x24 too; Terminal answers and a killed hook end it, and the verified
  screen takes over only from a hook that took nothing.
- clear: `hgs clear-context` starts a new conversation in the same agent process. For
  Codex, hgs must first not take the header above a message for its reset panel
  (zerus-g9dd, which a project folder short enough to show whole exposes).
- lifecycle: `hgs pause`, `hgs resume -d` on the same conversation, then `hgs terminate`.

Model and effort pickers and compaction are not reviewed on Windows and stay out. Every
wait has a deadline; a failure shows the session's screen, the host's log and the fake
model's requests. Each case stops what it started, its sessions, the host and the fake
model, and waits for every agent and supervisor through handles opened while they ran,
and until nothing holds its executables, before its folders go.
