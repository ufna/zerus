# Durable desktop read queue

The service's schema 4 includes indexed read intent and exact dispatch receipts.
The queue lives in `zerus_desktop_ledger::reads`; the service delivery component
is `src/desktop/delivery.rs`. Activation, writer handoff and frontend routing
belong to the service lifecycle. Merely opening the database or submitting an
intent never grants writer ownership. Existing `hgs read` remains unchanged.

`zerus-desktop-read-policy` contains the existing client `ReadMark`, field merge,
snapshot settlement, receipt interpretation and retry delays. The client reexports
its previous names and uses the shared policy. The service does not instantiate
the client's in-memory map of all pending reads.

## Intent and dispatch

`enqueue` requires a canonical UUID request and a nonempty, bounded mark naming
computer, session name, run and conversation. Computer/name/run/conversation form
the queue identity. Marks merge only within that identity. Each changed mark gets
a new revision; an unchanged request returns its original receipt even after the
mark is retired. Reusing a request ID for changed input refuses. The actor must
commit with its existing FULL SQLite durability before acknowledging acceptance.
Passive imports can record intent but cannot authorize delivery.

`reserve` checks the current non-revoked writer and service epochs in the same
IMMEDIATE transaction as its reservation. There are four global slots. Each slot
goes to a due computer with the fewest calls in flight, then its oldest due mark.
Indexed host summaries and per-computer due indexes avoid scanning pending marks.
Each returned ticket pins the attempt UUID, both epochs, queue sequence, revision
and exact mark. An attempt UUID is never reused, including after a crash.

The service worker checks the existing writer/service epoch and admits only
computers observed by its own fleet. It passes the exact mark to the selected
host's existing `hgs read` and honors cancellation and retained native resources.
A policy row or this reservation is not runtime handoff proof. No subprocess is launched by the queue itself.

`finish` requires the exact ticket. A result for an older revision releases only
its owned slot and cannot delay the changed mark. Exact repeat completion is
read-only; a changed result refuses. Revocation permits the original worker to
settle, but prohibits new dispatch. A new service epoch cannot settle an old
reserved attempt. `NotSent` releases a proven undelivered call without counting
a failure. The worker must not release its slot until its owned call has ended.

Failure delays remain 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, then 300 seconds. Confirmed delivery
waits 120 seconds. Partial application waits 120, 240, 480, then 960 seconds.
Changed intent resets the counters and becomes immediately eligible after any
older owned call ends. Clock addition saturates rather than overflowing.

## Observation and restart

A successful delivery receipt never retires a mark. `observe` accepts a fresh
authoritative catalog row in source order and the exact pending revision. It
uses the shared client settlement policy: changed run/conversation, a superseded
part, or confirmation of every still-current part retires the intent. A stale
pending revision cannot clear a newer mark. If a worker is still running, its
slot remains occupied until completion even when the snapshot has settled it.

Startup stays revoked and recovers at most four owned dispatches. Each old
attempt becomes permanently `unknown`; its pending acknowledgement survives
with failure backoff. Only read acknowledgements may receive a new attempt after
unknown delivery, because the host's exact run/conversation read operation is
idempotent. This grants no replay permission for posting, approvals or other
actions. A recovery error pauses this component and is visible in `read_queue`
status while IPC remains available.

## Bounds and proof

Each encoded mark is at most 32 KiB; its identity and individual fields have
smaller limits. Internal pages contain at most 128 rows, bounded by a captured
sequence watermark. They are not desktop-v1 frames; future transport must also
respect that protocol's byte limits. Maintained pending/in-flight totals make
status a constant-size indexed read. Receipt history stays on disk under the
service's database admission limit. Safe retention and allocated database/WAL
pressure qualification remain separate work; unresolved marks and unknown
attempt identities must never be evicted to admit an effect.

Focused tests cover durable reopen, default revocation, exact request/attempt
replay, stale completion and snapshot refusal, changed intent during an owned
call, partial application, fair four-slot admission and SQLite-full rollback.
A 50,000-row fixture verifies indexed host, due and keyset query plans without
table scans or temporary sorting and checks bounded dispatch and pagination.

## Service delivery interface

Schema 11 adds the explicit default-off automatic-approval policy, immutable
policy request receipts and an index for bounded catalog lookup by session name.
The actor calls `Runtime::start(config, epoch)` only under its existing lifecycle
ownership. `poll(&mut Store)` never waits for a running executor. Four read slots
and two approval slots include resources retained by the native runner, even
when its main worker has returned. `request_stop()` cancels admission and owned
calls; `drained()` remains false while an original worker, persistence completion
or runner resource remains held.

After successfully applying an internal `FleetEvent`, the actor calls
`observe(&Store, &event)` while retaining its ingress permit. Failed apply,
incomplete/offline sources and passive UI feed frames cannot establish delivery
evidence. Discovery visits one catalog page per second, with at most 128 rows;
read retirement keyset-pages at most 16 pending intents per tick, with a captured
sequence watermark. It looks up each session through the catalog index and uses
the existing exact settlement policy, including superseded run identities. An
unacknowledged early intent cannot starve later intents.

The component accepts three closed request shapes for the existing desktop-v1
request transport:

- `read_intent`: canonical UUID `request_id` and the exact `mark` fields
  `computer`, `name`, `run_id`, `conversation_id`, `reply_id`, and
  `attention_signature`. Acceptance follows the queue commit; it means queued,
  never delivered or read.
- `automatic_approvals`: canonical UUID `request_id` and Boolean `enabled`.
  This explicit service policy does not import the old Qt or UI opt-in. The
  policy update and immutable request receipt commit together. Replaying an old
  request returns that receipt without undoing a newer setting.
- `delivery_result`: a new canonical UUID `request_id` and the canonical
  `original_request_id`. This indexed lookup returns the original acceptance
  receipt after a transport timeout; it neither replays nor proves delivery.

All store and approval-journal mutations stay on the actor. Bounded executors
perform native I/O and return one bounded completion. A failed worker start
retains its original reservation as not sent. A failed completion commit retains
the exact completion for persistence retry, without invoking the native action
again. Status distinguishes the queue, policy, held slots and component errors.

## Automatic approvals

A current service catalog row is only a discovery candidate. An executor must
inspect the actual live native session and match its run, conversation and
reviewed one-time question/choice through the existing automatic-approval
selector. The actor rechecks its current source, writer and explicit policy,
then commits the existing private approval journal reservation before scheduling
an answer. The answer carries that reservation's original native request UUID
and the exact question hash/run/conversation selectors. Broader grants, ordinary
questions and startup trust remain manual.

Unknown, prepared or previously settled journal reservations never authorize
another answer, including after a restart. Disabling the policy cancels pending
inspections and answers; cancellation after a possible send remains unknown.
Read receipt retries remain distinct from this no-replay approval rule. Neither
status nor a command receipt establishes worker drain, currentness or release.
