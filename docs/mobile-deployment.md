# Android and mobile relay setup

The first Android client operates existing Zerus sessions through a self-hostable
HTTPS relay. Read the [architecture and trust model](mobile-architecture.md)
before choosing a server. Source components are under `mobile/android/` and
`services/mobile/`. The repository's MIT license applies except for the
attributed Apache-2.0 MuxPod terminal adaptations bundled with Android.

## Build and install Android

Use JDK 17 or 21 and an Android SDK with platform 36 and build tools. The checked-in
Gradle wrapper verifies its distribution checksum.

```sh
cd mobile/android
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Android/Sdk"
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

The debug APK is suitable for a private pilot. It is not a signed store release.
Keep a production signing key outside the repository and retain it for upgrades.
For a non-debuggable pilot with release performance, run
`./gradlew assemblePilot lintPilot` and install
`app/build/outputs/apk/pilot/app-pilot.apk`. This variant
uses the same development signing key for pilot upgrades; it is not a store release.
The application ID is `app.zerus.mobile`; the minimum Android version is 8.0
(API 26). The default build requires no Firebase account or private credentials.
See [Android build details](../mobile/android/README.md) for optional FCM setup.

## Start the relay

The [relay README](../services/mobile/README.md) documents Python and Docker
installation, administrator commands, limits and push configuration. The default SQLite profile supports one relay process for local/private setups.
Production multiple-worker deployments use the documented
[PostgreSQL profile and offline migration](../services/mobile/README.md#postgresql-production-profile).
A minimal SQLite Docker deployment is:

```sh
cd services/mobile
docker compose build
docker compose run --rm relay provision \
  --name 'Example workspace' --computer-name 'Example computer'
docker compose up -d relay
```

Provisioning prints a workspace UUID, computer UUID, computer credential and a
phone invitation. Save these privately. The invitation is usable once and expires
after ten minutes; generate another with the local `invite --workspace UUID`
command when ready to pair.

Terminate TLS with your existing reverse proxy, forwarding to
`127.0.0.1:8787`, or use the optional Caddy profile. A proxy must allow at least
40 seconds for long polls and 1 MiB ordinary request bodies. File-bearing sends
use a larger envelope only at `/v1/requests`: allow 29 MiB there and 75 seconds
for a mobile upload. Disable API request buffering to disk and request/body/header
logging. Only the HTTPS port should be accessible remotely. Configure
`trusted_proxy_cidrs` to the exact proxy peer IP/CIDR visible to the relay; for a
host-local Nginx this is normally `127.0.0.1/32`. Never trust every private subnet
or caller-supplied forwarding headers. The supplied Caddy profile overwrites
`X-Forwarded-For` and uses its explicitly assigned bridge address; change both
its network and the relay's private trust configuration if the subnet conflicts.
Keep the dynamic IPAM range separate from Caddy's static address; the supplied
`172.30.78.128/25` allocation range excludes its `.2` address.

`/healthz` is cheap process liveness, independent of database availability.
`/readyz` coalesces a bounded database readiness probe with a one-second cache. Inline attachment ingestion and claim
responses share one large-payload lane per worker until complete; overload
returns 429 with a retry hint. Private response spooling uses disk, with a
64 MiB reservation budget per worker, rather than the container's small tmpfs.
Phone catalogs and receipts enforce the installed 1 MiB total response limit
before sending headers. Event pages fit an encoded prefix and advance only
through returned IDs; oversized legacy data returns an explicit 413.
Keep spool permissions 0700, reserve free disk for all workers and monitor actual
container memory as well as process RSS. A 256 MiB limit is a safety setting,
not demonstrated high-fanout capacity. See the relay README for limits and the
[storage/admission contract](relay-architecture.md) for scale boundaries.

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header Forwarded "";
    proxy_set_header Connection "";
    proxy_read_timeout 45s;
    proxy_send_timeout 45s;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    client_max_body_size 1m;
    access_log off;
}

location = /v1/requests {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8787;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header Forwarded "";
    proxy_set_header Connection "";
    proxy_read_timeout 75s;
    proxy_send_timeout 75s;
    client_body_timeout 75s;
    client_max_body_size 29m;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    access_log off;
}
```

Use a real certificate trusted by Android. The application does not disable
certificate validation or accept arbitrary cleartext endpoints. Verify
`https://relay.example.com/healthz` returns `ok: true` and `protocol_version: 1`.
The reserved domain in these examples must be replaced with your own.

## Connect a computer

Install the Python package on each computer that already has `hgs`. The connector
uses the local CLI, so existing native accounts, hooks, conversations and safety
checks continue to apply. Do not stop or relaunch native sessions for setup.

```sh
python3 -m venv "$HOME/.local/share/zerus-mobile/venv"
"$HOME/.local/share/zerus-mobile/venv/bin/pip" install ./services/mobile
install -d -m 700 "$HOME/.config/hgs/mobile"
```

Create `$HOME/.config/hgs/mobile/connector.json` privately with mode 0600:

```json
{
  "server_url": "https://relay.example.com",
  "node_token": "REPLACE_WITH_PRIVATE_COMPUTER_CREDENTIAL",
  "hgs_path": "/home/user/.local/bin/hgs",
  "poll_interval": 5,
  "state_dir": "/home/user/.local/state/hgs/mobile-connector"
}
```

Use absolute paths appropriate for the computer. Do not paste credentials into
shell command arguments, issues or version control. The state directory belongs
to one relay and computer credential; use a new directory if those change and
retain the old one for uncertain-delivery review.

Run the connector in the foreground initially:

```sh
"$HOME/.local/share/zerus-mobile/venv/bin/zerus-mobile-connector" \
  --config "$HOME/.config/hgs/mobile/connector.json"
```

For persistent Linux operation, use a dedicated systemd user service:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Zerus mobile computer connector
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=%h/.local/share/zerus-mobile/venv/bin/zerus-mobile-connector --config %h/.config/hgs/mobile/connector.json
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5
UMask=0077
NoNewPrivileges=true

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Save it as `~/.config/systemd/user/zerus-mobile-connector.service`, then run
`systemctl --user daemon-reload` and
`systemctl --user enable --now zerus-mobile-connector.service`. Start it from
the user service manager so it does not inherit a running agent's environment.
The service only manages its connector process. Stop it with the corresponding
`systemctl --user stop` command; native agents keep running.

## Configure the connector from the desktop

Settings → Mobile connection edits the computer's existing connector file at
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hgs/mobile/connector.json`, or
`$HOME/.config/hgs/mobile/connector.json` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset.
The default official URL is `https://relay.zerus.dev`. The configured computer
credential stays hidden; leaving Replacement computer credential blank retains
it. Saving writes private configuration only. Changes take effect after the
connector restarts; copied start/restart commands require deliberate execution.
Wait for active connector requests and receipts to drain before restarting it.
Native agents and their hosts keep running.

The managed official-relay migration preserves the original binding identity and
receipt directory. A different relay or replacement computer credential requires
a new, unused private receipt directory. The panel never copies or deletes old
receipts; retain them for uncertain-delivery review. Connector service status is
read-only and does not prove relay connectivity or that the saved configuration
is currently active.

## Pair the phone

Open Zerus, choose **Machines → Pair another workspace**, enter the HTTPS server URL and the
current invitation code, and confirm. A `zerus://pair?server=...&code=...` link can
prefill these fields, but the app still requires explicit confirmation. Treat
such a link as a credential until it is consumed or expires.

The app opens on Sessions, grouped by projects containing matching sessions.
Use the desktop-style All sessions, Needs attention, Working, Saved sessions,
and Archive filters, or select one or more computers. Projects shows the logical
project catalog, including empty projects; project details offer a View sessions
action. Open a session to read messages, send a message or answer a supported
question. Attach documents using the composer's file picker: up to
eight files, ten MiB per file and twenty MiB total. The app keeps private copies
with the draft. Sending immediately adds an outgoing message with its delivery
status and frees the composer for the next text.

Previously opened conversations show retained private cached history, when
available for the exact target, while the computer refreshes it. The header
distinguishes last known state from verified current state. Typing remains
available during refresh; sending and other native actions
wait for a verified session. The composer expands for long text, keeps keyboard
selection during updates, and brings your own outgoing message into view.
Reading older messages pauses automatic following; use Jump to latest to resume.

The context row above the composer shows native context usage and provider cache
state. Open it for the reported window, token breakdown, last-request cache use,
native cost data and compaction state. Unknown values stay unknown. A reported
warm-cache deadline is an estimate; cached or archived inspections are marked
as last known.

The header also opens session details and Terminal. Details includes native model
and effort settings, task lists, goals, child activity and process output. Native
capabilities determine available lifecycle actions. Terminal uses the existing
pane and a separate saved input buffer; its key toolbar can interact with native
prompts. A result marked unconfirmed must be checked through its original
receipt before preparing another attempt.

Upgrade the connector's `hgs` executable together with the connector when using
new native operations. A private executable path in `connector.json` can keep
the mobile connector on a reviewed build without replacing the desktop CLI.
Before restarting a connector, wait for its active mutation attempts to finish.
Restart only the connector service; leave native agents, tmux and owning DeepSeek
hosts running. Older resident adapters may advertise fewer supported operations.

Upgrade both relay and connector before using context controls. Each advertises
its supported operations, and the agent's live inspection must also permit the
action. Compact keeps the draft. Clear requires confirmation and does not send
it. When continuing with a cold cache, choose full context, compact and continue,
clear, or cancel. Compact and continue sends only after the exact native request
completes and the original draft remains unchanged. Editing, navigating away,
restarting or cancelling the pending send keeps it from being sent automatically.
An uncertain operation offers a read-only receipt check rather than a retry.

The Drafts tab preserves unsent text, files and uncertain attempts. An unknown
delivery must be checked against its
receipt and the conversation before deliberately sending again. Archive entries
open their exact saved conversation in read-only mode. Upgrade both the relay
and computer connector before using archive inspection. Session creation and
restoration are available when the gateway, connector and native adapter
advertise the corresponding operations. Archive content stays read-only;
restore, rename, fork and forget operate on its exact saved identity.

Disconnecting a workspace revokes that phone's credential and push registration.
Saved drafts remain private on the phone. An administrator can also revoke a
phone or computer through the relay CLI.

## Enable notifications

Grant Android's notification permission when prompted. The Computers tab exposes
notification setup and the optional live connection.

- For UnifiedPush, install and configure a distributor such as
  [ntfy](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/phone/) or
  [another supported distributor](https://unifiedpush.org/users/distributors/).
  Select it in Zerus. The relay's `push_hosts` must permit its exact public HTTPS
  hostname. A self-hosted distributor needs no Firebase service account.
- For FCM, configure the Android build and the relay using your Firebase project.
  The relay needs its own private service-account file; never put that file in the
  APK. Both sides must use the same Firebase project. Without those credentials,
  FCM delivery is unavailable even though the integration code builds.
- The live connection needs no distributor or Firebase project. Enable it while
  the app is open; its persistent notification exposes a Stop action. It uses
  an ongoing outbound connection. Android Doze, vendor battery management and
  force-stop can affect delivery, so it is a fallback rather than a guarantee of
  background wake availability.

Push payloads contain a generic wake signal. The app retrieves current events
through the authenticated relay. A provider's successful HTTP response only
acknowledges acceptance; verify delivery on the actual target phone.

## Verify and recover

Use a disposable session to test pairing, reading, sending, answering and an
attention notification. Close the phone UI for the notification check. Then
temporarily disconnect the computer network: the app should report the computer
offline after refreshing the computer catalog. An open conversation retains its
cached history and draft, labels its native status Last known after an inspection
fails, and blocks native actions until a new inspection succeeds. Never test
destructive lifecycle operations on an unrelated live agent.

The source includes a fully synthetic `fixture_hgs.py` used by the HTTP
integration tests. It does not invoke native agents or tmux. Run local checks:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=services/mobile python3 -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -v
python3 scripts/ci/check-source.py
```

Run the Python tests in an environment with the relay dependencies installed.
Android unit tests and lint are separate from these tests. No command in this
runbook dispatches hosted CI.

For SQLite, back up relay data through its online backup API or with the relay
stopped. PostgreSQL needs a reviewed PostgreSQL backup/restore procedure.
SQLite-to-PostgreSQL cutover is an offline owner-approved operation: keep the
old relay writers stopped, preserve outstanding claims and identities, import
into an empty target with `migrate-sqlite --source-offline`, and verify before
starting new admission. After new PostgreSQL writes, an old SQLite snapshot is
not a safe rollback because it loses new mutation receipts. Follow the
[full migration procedure](../services/mobile/README.md#offline-sqlite-migration).
Never restore old command claims to the queued state. A claimed request after a
relay or connector crash remains uncertain until reviewed. Keep API access logs
off, preserve the connector journal, and revoke exposed credentials individually.
