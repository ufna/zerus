# Zerus reference

[Product overview](../README.md) | [Installation](installation.md)

This reference covers session lifecycle, desktop workflows and native integration
limits. Run `hgs -h` for the complete command syntax.

## CLI sessions

`hgs` starts a command in a named project tmux session and attaches locally or
through SSH. The session survives a closed terminal, an SSH interruption or a
sleeping client while its host remains running. Terminal windows, tabs and splits
belong to your terminal emulator; tmux provides the persistent session.

```sh
hgs claude sample-project           # attach if present; otherwise start Claude
hgs @mac claude sample-project      # the same operation over SSH
hgs ls                             # local and peer sessions
hgs a claude/sample-project/review  # attach by full name
hgs kill claude/sample-project      # remove the hgs binding; keep native history
hgs pause --all                     # pause verified idle sessions
hgs resume --all                    # restore saved sessions in the background
hgs project ls                     # legacy local folder aliases
hgs claude sample-project -c        # continue the latest conversation in the folder
hgs --dry-run claude sample-project # show the tmux/SSH command
```

Pass an absolute folder path when no alias is configured. `--new` generates a
fresh session name; `--new -n review` uses your label and rejects an occupied name.
Arguments after `--` go to the agent or project wrapper. Arbitrary terminal commands
can run through `hgs`; native lifecycle and Activity functions require an adapter.

## Pause, resume and reboot

```sh
hgs pause claude/sample-project/review
hgs pause --all
# Reboot the machine running the agents after checking the pause result.
hgs ls
hgs resume claude/sample-project/review
hgs resume --all
hgs a claude/sample-project/review
hgs @mac pause --all
```

Pause preserves an exact native conversation binding. It does not preserve open
network connections, child processes or an unsent native terminal draft. Supported
integrations include Claude Code, Codex, Kimi Code and the official DeepSeek Harness;
the latter uses its native engine instead of a terminal-agent process.

For terminal agents, pause verifies the live pane, run and conversation identity,
native history, supported resume arguments and an idle state. It sends SIGTERM only
to the verified agent process, checking its PID and start time, and waits up to ten
seconds. It never kills the tmux server or escalates a failed pause to SIGKILL.
`pause --all` preflights every live session on the host: an untracked agent, busy
session or ordinary shell blocks the operation before the first signal. Once
stopping begins, some sessions can fail independently; inspect the nonzero result
before rebooting.

Restore uses `claude --resume ID`, `codex resume ID`, `kimi --session ID` or the
supported native DeepSeek operation. It preserves the original folder, account
and project wrapper. There is no fallback to the latest conversation or a new
conversation when exact restore fails. `resume -d` and `resume --all` run in the
background; use `hgs a ...` when native startup needs input. A normal launch with a
saved name restores it; `--fresh` explicitly replaces its binding.

You can also resume native history created outside `hgs`:

```sh
hgs codex -c 01a0e955-b037-73f0-bc6c-36622a8c27b7
hgs codex /path/to/project --resume=01a0e955-b037-73f0-bc6c-36622a8c27b7 -n review
```

After `-c`, IDs are recognized as UUIDs; Kimi also accepts `session_UUID`. Without
an ID, `-c` continues the latest conversation in the project. An already tracked
conversation keeps its session name; another gets `resume-ID` unless `-n` is set.
An occupied name bound to another conversation is an error. Native history must
remain on the selected host: project synchronization does not move conversations.

Before the agent confirms its conversation and creates native history, pause is
unavailable. Codex and Kimi may defer creation until the first message. Codex can
also defer `SessionStart` after resume; Activity may send the first resumed message
only after verifying the exact process, matching history and empty native input.
Unknown flags or noninteractive modes such as `codex exec` are not guessed.
The original positional prompt is never replayed during resume.

A launch interrupted before conversation confirmation is not a Saved session.
Repeat the same command without `--fresh`; the diagnostic attempt is preserved in
`attempts/`, and native history is retained. Old untracked sessions cannot be safely
paused: launch the intended conversation with its explicit native ID to bind it.

### Tracking and durable state

At launch, `hgs` adds handlers to Claude `settings.json`, Codex `hooks.json` and
Kimi `config.toml`, preserving other hooks and making a `.pre-hgs` backup before the
first edit. It respects `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` and `KIMI_CODE_HOME`.
Handlers do nothing outside an `hgs` run. `HGS_TRACKING=0` disables registration for
new launches. Native hook trust still requires an explicit user choice in Codex.
Tracked Codex needs `--no-daemon`; the integration has been verified with 0.160.0,
while 0.155.1 lacks that required flag.

New hooks call `hgs __state hook`. Existing trusted Python commands are retained:
`hgs_state.py` forwards them to the Rust CLI, so keep Python for legacy hooks.
The CLI and session core are Rust; SQLite is bundled and requires a C compiler at
build time. Existing session bindings and provider history remain compatible.

Session records live in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/hgs/sessions`, or
`HGS_STATE_DIR`. Writes are atomic and synchronized to disk. Records contain the
command and arguments, folder, conversation ID and run identity; environment
secrets are not saved. A secret passed directly as an argument is still an argument
and can appear in the private record. Native agents retain their full history.
Late events from a previous run and child-agent events cannot rebind the parent.

`runtime_state`, `process_state` and `conversation_state` distinguish the tmux
terminal, agent process and native conversation. `SessionEnd` alone does not prove
process exit. A live process without verified activity shows **Status unknown**;
**Agent exited** means the process ended while its tmux terminal still exists.

### Rename, Saved and Archive

**Rename…** changes the label after the project name without replacing the process
or working folder. Tracking and journal history follow the new name; attached
terminals receive updated titles. Archive renaming targets only the selected ID.

```sh
hgs rename codex/project-docs/review codex/project-docs/database-review
hgs @mac rename claude/sample-project/review claude/sample-project/deploy
hgs rename codex/project-docs/review codex/project-docs/database-review --archive ID
```

Live and Saved names must be free. Archive names may repeat. Labels accept Unicode
and internal spaces, but reject `/`, `:`, `.`, control characters and surrounding
whitespace. `--dry-run` validates without mutation; `HGS_TAB=0` disables title updates.

**Saved sessions** are unfinished conversations paused explicitly or left after
process interruption, tmux loss or reboot. **Archive** contains completed
conversations. For automatic archiving, a tracked run needs both native main
conversation completion and a successful process exit without evidence of pause
or an external signal. `SessionEnd`, an SSH disconnect or a completed reply alone
is insufficient. Older ambiguous records are not reclassified automatically.

```sh
hgs archive codex/my-project/review                 # stopped sessions only
hgs ls --local --json
hgs inspect codex/my-project/review --archive ID
hgs resume codex/my-project/review --archive ID -d
hgs kill codex/my-project/review --archive ID        # forget only this binding
```

Archives live in `archives/`, each with an independent ID. A new launch with the
same name preserves the archive. Restore refuses an occupied live or Saved name
and removes an archive binding only after the native agent confirms the expected
conversation. Failed restore keeps it. **Forget archive** preserves native history;
`resume --all` excludes archives.

## Project wrappers

An executable `run_COMMAND.sh` in the project folder runs inside the tmux session.
Use it to prepare the environment and launch the native agent.

```sh
hgs codex sample-project                 # run_codex.sh starts a new conversation
hgs codex sample-project -c              # run_codex.sh resume --last
hgs codex sample-project -- resume ID     # continue this exact conversation
hgs codex sample-project --bare          # bypass the wrapper
```

Explicit arguments after `--` suppress automatic Codex `resume --last` insertion,
even with `-c`. Use `-- resume --last --model MODEL` when needed. Claude and Kimi
forward `-c` to their wrapper. Existing sessions attach without rerunning the
wrapper. Interactive setup needs an attached launch; detached mode assumes the
required environment is already available. Never put private keys in wrappers.

<a id="desktop"></a>

## Desktop workspace

The tray's **Open Zerus**, a left click or `hgs-tray --sessions` opens the workspace.
On macOS, use `~/Applications/hgs-tray.app/Contents/MacOS/hgs-tray --sessions`.
Repeated launch raises the existing window. Closing it leaves the tray and agents
running. The installed application and service names remain `hgs-tray` for
compatibility; the title is `hgs zerus`.

The tray has two counters: all sessions and **Needs attention**. Attention includes
input, approvals, errors and unread main-agent replies. An offline host retains
its last total but adds no live attention requests; a dot marks incomplete data.
Linux application badges and the macOS Dock show the attention count, hiding zero.

Notifications open Activity for the exact requesting run and conversation,
including remote or renamed sessions. Polling and restarts do not repeat the same
request; resolved notifications are removed. Main-agent replies and explicit child
questions can notify; ordinary child results and errors stay with the parent.
Delivery failures show a reason and retry after a minute while still relevant.
macOS uses Notification Center and needs its system permission; Focus and OS
notification settings still apply.

**Sessions**, **Projects**, **Machines** and **Accounts** share the navigation rail;
click the logo for **Overview**. Overview shows attention, work in progress,
online machines, CPU, memory and load, plus account limits. Counts open the matching
filter, sessions open Activity, and machine settings lead to Machines. Native
account quotas are grouped by verified identity instead of adding machine usage.

Session rows show provider, machine, current action, model, effort and Git context.
**Ready** means a reply ended, not that a long-running task is complete. Working
and compacting timers use native start evidence and update locally without extra
host requests. Theme, density, animation and machine/project label appearance are
local preferences. **Settings → Appearance → Content scale** adjusts Activity,
questions, the message field and Terminal from 75% to 200% in 5% steps, with 100%
as the default; the session list, the side panel, the session header and its tabs
keep their size.
**Settings → Appearance → Activity width** keeps Activity readable in a wide or
fullscreen window: the transcript, its queued input, questions and the message
field share one centered column of at most 900 px by default (480–2400 px). The
width is measured at 100% and grows with content scale, so lines keep their
length. The scroll bar stays at the pane edge and the side margins scroll the
transcript. Drag either column edge in Activity to resize the column
symmetrically, or double-click an edge to restore 900 px. **Full-width Activity**,
in Settings and in Activity's context menu, fills the whole pane; **Reset Activity
width** in the same menu restores the default column. Narrower panes use their
full width, and Terminal, Processes and Native UI are not affected. A reset icon
appears beside an Appearance slider's value once it differs from the default and
restores that default.
**Settings → Appearance → Keep Zerus above other windows** keeps the Zerus window
over other applications on X11, macOS and KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland. On KDE Wayland,
Zerus uses temporary KWin scripts scoped to its own window and confirms the
compositor's state; it installs no window rules. The pin above Settings on the
left rail switches the same option, and both controls follow changes made in
KDE's window menu. The unpinned icon is a muted tilted outline; the pinned icon
is upright, filled and gold, with a small line beneath it. The icon follows the
confirmed window state and retains its color across theme changes. Hover only
highlights the button background; its tooltip names the next action.
KWin rules can override the preference; Zerus explains a
refused change. Other Wayland desktops require their own integration and show
the option disabled with a window-menu/rules workaround. Files and terminals
opened from Zerus may appear behind it. Missing Git metadata does not turn
a folder into a repository.

The **+** in the session list header opens **New session**, like the one in the
side rail. The button beside **⋯** collapses the list into a strip. Every project
band and session row keeps its height, so each session
becomes a square tile: status and provider icons, the session name on up to two
lines and a short state such as the working time. Instead of the attention
edge, a tile's frame takes the color of its state (working, needing an answer,
error, paused, draft or a new reply) with a faint glow inward. Each band shows
the project name and its most urgent counter. Above the tiles and as wide as
them, the strip keeps a search button and two filters: the active one and the
most urgent other one (sessions needing an answer, otherwise working sessions,
otherwise all). Rows open on click and name their session in a tooltip;
tiles do not open a session's subagents. Expanding grows the same rows back
into cards. The strip's search button opens the full list over the conversation
without resizing it; Escape or a click outside returns to the strip, and the pin
docks the list again. While the pointer rests on the
strip, the full list opens over the conversation; turn this off with **Settings →
Sessions → Expand the collapsed session list on hover**. The collapsed state and
the docked width are local preferences.

Search names, folders, branches and models immediately. From two characters,
content search also reads public Codex, Claude and Kimi messages and saved tool
events on each host. Machine and state filters narrow results; the all-sessions
view includes archives. Results open the recorded message; **Back to latest
activity** returns to the live timeline. **Limited history searched**, **Some
history unavailable** and excerpt labels describe incomplete coverage. Internal
reasoning and system instructions are excluded.

**New reply** stays unread until its latest result is visible in an active window
or an attached Terminal at the bottom. Background windows and old search results
do not clear it. Read state survives rename and resume on this device. Viewing
never answers an approval. **Mark as read** clears the current reminder without
answering the agent; **Mark needs attention** creates a local review reminder.
Opening the conversation does not clear an explicit review reminder.

Ctrl/Command-click selects multiple sessions while preserving the open conversation
and draft. Batch actions include read/review later, pause, resume, archive, project
move, termination and forgetting. Applicability is shown per selection. Ctrl-click
does not select project headers or subagents. Escape or the selection close button
clears selection. Context menus and shortcuts preserve the target identity.
**Clear archive…** requires confirmation, preserves offline records and excludes
new records created after the confirmation snapshot; native history remains.

Common shortcuts: Ctrl/Command-F searches, Ctrl/Command-R refreshes, Enter opens the
selected live session and Escape closes the current transient UI; it never closes
the workspace.
An archive needs explicit **Restore**; Enter does not start it.

<a id="activity"></a>

## Activity, messages and native controls

Activity shows recorded public messages and tool events rather than a full copy
of native history. User messages preserve literal text, Markdown markers and
line breaks; agent replies render Markdown. The copy button at the right of a
reply's header puts its Markdown source on the clipboard; a text selection still
copies the visible text. Claude's recorded thinking appears in
full as a quieter **Thinking** card: the same Markdown at the same size, without
the card fill and with dimmer text. Adjacent tool events collapse into groups.
Reading older history preserves scroll and selection; **Jump to latest** returns
to live events without resizing the timeline. Claude hands finished
background work and other sessions' messages back as a new turn. Activity never
shows them as your message: a background task becomes a violet **Background
task** notice, a subagent's final report a **Subagent report** with one summary
line and **Show report** for the full Markdown, and a message from another
Claude session a **Message from** notice with its full text. Search and the
session's last request ignore all three.

The owner-only `events.sqlite3` journal sits with session records on the agent host
and retains about 50,000 events per machine. Excerpts can contain project data.
Pause/resume continues the same conversation journal. Selected Activity normally
polls every 2.5 seconds while visible; host lists poll every five seconds, and the
tray keeps its background polling when the workspace is closed.

Kimi replies and intermediate public messages come from the exact conversation's
`agents/main/wire.jsonl` when Stop lacks text. Transcript reads are bounded to an
8 MiB tail, 50 replies and 32,000 characters per reply. Late copies do not duplicate
cards. Nested `codex exec` runs with verified `source: exec` register as children
instead of changing the parent conversation. `/new` and `/clear` still change the
main native conversation.

### Sending and attachments

Enter sends, Shift-Enter inserts a line and Escape releases focus while keeping
the draft, unless a turn is working. Paste images, drag local files or use the
attachment button. Attachments collect in one chip in the fixed-height toolbar
above the message field, next to session notices (cache, account limit,
recovery) and the context counter; its popover previews, opens and removes them. Labels such as `[Image #1]` and `[File #2]` preserve
attachment placement within the text; removing one does not renumber the rest. Text, cursor/selection and attachment
bytes are saved locally as they change, separately for each machine, session and
subagent. They survive GUI crashes, restarts, unavailable machines and ended
sessions, even if the original attachment file is gone. Storage is a private
directory next to the desktop's Qt settings file (`<settings-file>.drafts`),
outside P2P configuration sync.

**Saved drafts** below the session list lets you preview, copy or restore drafts
from ended or missing sessions into the current session. Copying keeps the dialog
open; restoring never sends anything and replacing an existing draft requires
confirmation. A source draft remains available after copying it to another session.
Confirmed sends clear the outgoing draft; failures retain it. After an interrupted
or uncertain send, check Activity or Terminal before explicitly allowing another
send. Saving failures are shown in the editor and retried locally; sending starts
only after its recovery snapshot has been saved.

Delivery verifies the exact run, process, conversation and native input state.
Confirmed receipts are idempotent by request ID. An uncertain result is never
retried automatically; inspect the native UI before submitting again. A session
change or stale request cannot send into another conversation. Busy-session queue
controls follow the native agent's capabilities; unsupported operations remain
in Terminal or Native UI. Codex ordinary deferred follow-ups remain read-only
unless its native UI offers the supported promotion operation.

**Stop** interrupts the current turn and cancels recovery without terminating the
session; Escape anywhere in the workspace except Terminal does the same while
the selected session's turn is working, after first clearing a search being
typed. Once the turn is interrupted, its prompt returns to an empty message field
for editing; a started draft is kept. Claude, Codex and Kimi use verified native
Escape; Claude sends no event for it, so HGS records the interruption once
Claude shows it. Stopped before its first reply, Claude rewinds the turn and
puts the prompt back into its own input instead; HGS then moves exactly that
text from Terminal to the message field (Ctrl+Y in Terminal brings it back) and
leaves any other input untouched. Supported DeepSeek hosts use native cancel.
Native queue behavior still applies: Codex Escape may start a queued follow-up.
Uncertain interruption is not repeated.

When Claude suggests your next message after a turn, Activity shows it as the
empty message field's placeholder, as Claude's terminal does; Tab inserts it.
Sending a message, a new turn or a new conversation removes the suggestion.
Claude writes it with an internal agent, which is neither listed as a subagent
nor shown in Activity.

File links retain their visible path and source position. Relative references
resolve against that session's folder. Local references can open the file or its
parent folder; remote references identify the host and offer an SSH terminal
instead of treating the remote path as local. Display alone downloads or launches
nothing. Copying the path keeps the dialog open so you can copy first and then
choose an opening action. Desktop dispatch happens after the reference dialog is
destroyed so Wayland activation does not depend on a disappearing window.

### Questions and approvals

Activity exposes supported native questions with their full visible disclosure,
options, queue position and request time. It never submits a highlighted option
without a user action. Answers are scoped to the unchanged run, process,
conversation and request hash; uncertain input is not automatically retried.
Unsent freeform answers, choices and the current question page are also saved
locally. They restore only for the same machine/session, run, conversation and
question hash. Interrupted submissions remain locked until reviewed; confirmed
queued answers keep their submitted state after a GUI restart.
Unsupported or truncated native prompts remain in Terminal.

Claude tool approvals keep the session at **Needs approval** and appear in
Activity while Claude shows its chooser. When the complete panel matches the
agent's request, such as the Bash command, file name or fetched host, Activity
lists Claude's options verbatim after a short review delay. Options that reach
beyond this request, such as always allowing, blocking, session-wide grants or
mode switches, are marked and need a second **Confirm** click. Choosing a **No**
option ends Claude's turn as in Terminal; the composer reopens after Claude's
prompt is verified. A clipped or unrecognized panel, a mismatched request and
plan approval stay visible with **Open Terminal**.

Supported startup prompts include Claude workspace trust and auto-mode consent,
Codex folder access and **Hooks need review**, and Kimi folder/MCP trust. These
can appear before a conversation exists, but only with verified startup identity.
Claude workspace trust preserves its full permissions warning; Kimi includes the
visible MCP commands. Trust persistence belongs to the native agent.
Claude's auto-mode prompt accepts absolute workspace paths and native `~/…`
abbreviations that match the verified launch directory. It remains answerable
after the initial conversation is bound, until a turn starts.
For Codex hooks, **Review hooks** opens the native browser in Terminal;
**Trust all and continue** and **Continue without trusting** are explicit choices.
Review input with an uncertain result is never retried automatically.

Optional Codex questions preserve the regular composer and support **Skip**.
Queue arrows navigate optional requests from newest to oldest while retaining
answers and the current multipart section. A required approval temporarily takes
priority. Confirmed answers appear as **You (answer)** in Activity. Codex optional
question replies show the question and your answer in separate sections,
preserving the literal answer text.

If an optional answer enters Codex's native queue, the question stays visible as
**Submitted / Awaiting agent** with the original answer locked. Submission means
the verified terminal received the answer; it does not mean Codex has recorded
it yet. This state survives polling and GUI restarts. The card disappears after
the exact native question reply appears in the conversation. Zerus never resends
the answer or promotes the queue automatically; **Send now** remains an explicit
native queue action. Delivery without confirmed submission still requires
checking Terminal before retrying.

### Models, effort, context, goals and subagents

The Activity model selector changes supported per-session model/effort settings,
leaving account defaults intact. Codex/Kimi options come from the selected
account's native catalog. Before the first message, verified empty native input
can allow selection without creating a conversation. Startup prompts, drafts,
unconfirmed resume and an already submitted first message block that operation.
Claude controls and unverified states fall back to Terminal with an explanation.

Busy-session choices remain **Pending** until the agent is ready, including after
navigation away. A message sent before application uses the current model.
**Save for resume** stores a stopped session's choice without starting it. A stale
queued setting cannot replace a newer choice from another device.
If a message or another client already consumed or replaced it, Zerus refreshes
the current settings without retrying the stale request or showing a failure.
`hgs [@host] settings SESSION --json` exposes the same scoped operation.

Native clear/compact operations are capability-gated and require exact identity.
**Clear session** requires confirmation naming the session and host, preserves
unsent drafts and rechecks identity. DeepSeek context reset is unavailable until
its native Session Controller provides the supported operation. A confirmed clear
adds an amber **Session cleared** boundary to Activity and keeps the earlier local
timeline above it: the agent no longer sees that history, but you can still read
and search it. Resuming or opening another conversation starts a new timeline.
Codex can defer its new-session hook until the next message; its verified empty
native reset panel also confirms the clear, including `/clear` in Terminal. Old
context and prompt-cache values are hidden until the new conversation reports
native usage. The saved native identity changes only on the real hook, and an
unconfirmed command does not reset counters.
**Compact and continue** sends only after confirmed successful compaction with the same
unedited draft; errors, cancellation or identity/draft changes cancel submission.
Context metrics use native telemetry, without guessing a capacity from a model name.

**Tasks & agents**, **Details** and **Worktrees** occupy the resizable inspector.
Its width, tab and open state are local; toggling it preserves Activity, drafts and
Terminal attachment. Successful native task/plan tools supply recorded pending,
in-progress and completed items. Tool failures and Stop do not complete tasks.
There are up to 100 items per list and 65 lists, with truncation disclosed.
Old data shows **Last recorded**; unavailable history is not reconstructed.

Goals remain independent of turn state. Codex uses `goals_1.sqlite`, Claude uses
`goal_status` in the exact transcript, and Kimi uses native `goal.create/update/clear`
wire events. DeepSeek exposes its native phase and continuation permission.
Only recorded usage and budgets are shown; missing data is never inferred from a
prompt. Ready does not complete a goal.

Subagents open their own Activity and return through **Main activity**, preserving
the parent's draft. Individual child IDs and profile groups are distinguished;
unknown counts remain unknown. Ordinary child results/errors stay out of the
attention count, while explicit input/approval requests remain visible. DeepSeek
continuable children can receive messages through the native API with parent
verification; other adapters and one-shot children may expose history only.

**Fork session…** creates an independent native conversation in the same folder,
next to the original session in its group. Files remain shared. The CLI is
`hgs [@host] fork SESSION [-n NAME] [-d] [--archive ID]`; support depends on the agent.
DeepSeek native fork remains in Native UI.

Codex may defer `SessionStart` until the fork's first message. Activity enables
Send once Zerus verifies that the supervised process owns an independent child
history linked to the source conversation and its native composer is ready.
The child ID is confirmed by the agent's own event; the source session stays intact.

## Projects and P2P synchronization

A project has a stable ID, name, color, folders on multiple computers and session
membership. Drag sessions between projects without moving folders or replacing
agent processes. Drag headers, use the context menu or Alt-Up/Down to change local
order. Empty-project visibility, collapse state and default project are local.
**All swarm projects** explicitly shows the full shared catalog.

Folder entries contain a machine, path and optional label. Browse works for local
and remote folders, including ordinary non-Git directories. The desktop folder
list starts in alphabetical name order, ignoring case; column headings change
the sort. Sorting preserves the selected folder and does not reorder the shared
catalog. The divider below the list adjusts the folder/worktree heights and
remembers that choice locally; additional window height goes to the folders.
Worktree actions share its heading row, leaving more space for the folder list.
The general **New session** action inherits the selected session's project,
computer and matching project folder. For a linked worktree, a verified catalog
selects the main checkout instead. Choosing another folder, project or computer
cancels this automatic selection; explicit folder and worktree launch actions
keep their requested path.
Project switches in **New session** keep the machine and select that project's
folder. Only a path explicitly chosen through **Browse…** stays pinned per machine
within that dialog;
closing it clears this temporary choice. Selecting a listed folder unpins it.
A folder outside the project shows a warning and is added only after a successful
launch with the matching launch ID. Cancellation and launch failure add nothing.
A worktree of a project folder on that computer is not outside the project, so
starting there adds no folder; **Other worktrees…** offers it again.

New launches immediately show **Starting…** until the matching session appears.
Controls stay disabled before confirmation. Errors remove the placeholder and
show a reason; **Hide launch status** hides it while preserving a late session's
project placement. Existing names and unrelated sessions are never repurposed.
**Open terminal window** is off by default and remembered separately from the tray
open mode; DeepSeek uses its embedded native interface.

To join a swarm, configure SSH access and open Zerus on the initial machines so
existing projects import once. Use **Projects → Swarm… → Connect computer**,
**Preview connection**, review project mapping and **Join and merge projects**.
Names alone do not merge projects. Existing swarm membership wins by default;
turn off that preference to compare conflicting assignments. HGS backs up the
catalog before a merge. **Connect this member** adds a route to an existing member.

There is no permanent leader: each member stores the shared catalog and can relay
changes. One configured SSH connection is enough for exchange in both directions;
the other side needs no reverse SSH connection. Learning a machine ID through the
catalog does not create local transport access to it.

Shared fields are machine IDs/names, project IDs/names/colors, folder locations and
session membership. SSH hosts, users, ports, keys, proxies, credentials, transport
bindings, local order, filters, collapse/appearance and the default project stay
local. File contents and agent history are not copied. Offline hosts do not hide
projects with locally configured access.

The catalog and local bindings live in `~/.config/hgs/swarm/catalog.json`; do not
copy that complete file between machines because it contains node identity and
local transport bindings. `hgs swarm export` exports only shared fields. Original
Zerus settings stay in `workspace/organizationBeforeSwarm`; import/merge backups
use `~/.config/hgs/swarm/backup-*.json`.

The independent `hgs-swarm` service (`com.hgdev.hgs-swarm` on macOS) makes no network
requests without members. Local changes normally trigger exchange within three
seconds; unchanged peers are checked every 30 seconds, backing off to five minutes
on failure. Zerus reads the local catalog every five seconds without SSH. Offline
members catch up later. Independent fields merge; conflicts remain in the Swarm
review UI. Deletion records prevent old replicas from resurrecting data; this
version does not prune old journal records.

**Swarm → Conflicts** explains the affected session, archived session, project or
folder. Compare the values and the computers that saved them. **Shown now** marks
the temporary display choice; it does not mean the conflict has been resolved.
Select a row to preview the result, then use **Keep this project** or the matching
action. Project assignments change catalog placement without restarting agents
or removing conversations. Folder/project removals affect the shared catalog,
leave files and sessions intact, and require confirmation. The decision is shared
with connected computers and reaches offline members when they reconnect. Closing
the window postpones the decision. New conflicting versions clear the selection
and require another review, including if they arrive during a confirmation.

```sh
hgs swarm get
hgs swarm preview mac
hgs swarm sync
hgs swarm disconnect mac
```

Disconnect stops outbound exchange through that connection while retaining the
catalog and session access. It does not deny inbound exchange from an existing
member; SSH controls transport access. `HGS_SWARM_SERVICE=0 ./install.sh` skips
worker installation.

### Legacy CLI folder aliases

`~/.config/hgs/projects.local` retains `NAME=FOLDER` aliases for CLI compatibility.
The old infrastructure-owned `~/.config/hgs/projects` is no longer read. Aliases
import into Zerus once per machine; later project edits belong in Projects.

```sh
hgs project ls --json
hgs project add infra ~/work/infra
hgs project set infra ~/work/other
hgs project rm infra
```

Alias names reject spaces, `/` and `=`; logical project names are not restricted
that way. Absolute paths remain available directly from the CLI.

### Worktrees and ordinary folders

Existing Git worktrees appear in Projects and the session inspector. Clicking a
checkout filters Sessions while preserving the open conversation and draft.
**Other worktrees…** selects an existing checkout without changing machine, project
or account. Bare or unavailable copies cannot launch; ordinary Browse remains
available even without Git or after metadata errors.

**New worktree…** is an explicit user operation. Choose a new branch, base ref
(default `HEAD`) and unused destination under an existing parent directory. The
CLI is `hgs [@host] worktrees create --path /repo --branch feature/task
--destination /repo-task --base HEAD --json`. Zerus also verifies `--common-dir`
and a request ID. Creation uses normal `git worktree add -b`, including configured
checkout hooks, with no force, fetch or deletion. The ref is resolved before
creation. The five-minute operation can leave partial results after failure;
inspect the destination before retrying. Cancelling the session form preserves
the created folder and branch. Closing or archiving a session never removes them.

Catalog reads are on demand, with a 30-second repository cache; `--refresh`
bypasses it. Identity is machine plus canonical Git common directory, not equal
paths or repository names. Limits are three seconds, 1 MiB of Git output and
512 worktrees. Errors distinguish `not_repo`, `git_unavailable`, `metadata_error`,
`timeout`, `too_large` and `folder_unavailable`; previous data is explicitly stale.
The UI caches at most 64 snapshots and 8 MiB. See the
[worktree design](../design/worktree-support/index.html) for future cleanup ideas.

## Machines and accounts

**Machines** edits local SSH aliases and overrides in
`~/.config/hgs/machines.local.json`, leaving the shared `config` intact. Blank
fields inherit OpenSSH configuration. Effective values come from `ssh -G`
without connecting; `hgs machine resolve ALIAS` exposes the same result.
**Test connection** checks SSH and hgs/tmux versions. **Open SSH terminal** supports
interactive host-key verification. **Install hgs** builds the CLI remotely from
a selected checkout while preserving existing state. Unsaved machine drafts do
not change configuration; **Discard draft** removes the draft explicitly.

Multiple machine filters narrow both sessions and content search. Label color,
Bright/Soft mode and appearance previews are local. **All machines** clears the
restriction. A temporary connectivity error retains the last snapshot and makes
unavailable controls explicit.

<a id="accounts"></a>

### Accounts

Accounts collects provider profiles from connected machines. Verified provider
account ID, or email with organization, groups the same account across hosts;
matching display names alone do not. Providers, organizations and conflicting
IDs remain separate. Local results appear first; remote profiles arrive
incrementally. Known rows and selection survive refresh, failure and offline
hosts. Limits use one current account snapshot, never the sum of machine usage.

**Add account** creates a separate profile on the selected host and starts native
sign-in. Default/native profiles retain existing authorization. **New session**
selects an account for the chosen provider and machine. **Make default on…** sets
the default for new sessions; explicit `--account` wins, and attach, resume and fork
retain the original profile. Ordinary agent commands outside `hgs` keep their
native sign-in. Use `hgs [@host] account default native-claude` to restore the native
Claude default; removing a profile also removes its default assignment.

```sh
hgs account ls
hgs @mac account add work --provider codex --label Work
hgs @mac account login work
hgs @mac codex /path/to/project --new --account work
hgs account copy native-codex --from @local --to mac --as codex-work --label Work
```

`accounts.json` stores metadata and selected permission modes; authorization stays
in the profile's own directory. Managed profiles clear inherited API tokens;
native defaults keep the user's normal environment. Tokens are not displayed in
UI, and the mere presence of a file does not prove valid sign-in. Claude managed
profiles support claude.ai login; shared Claude Console authorization is not
isolated by this mechanism. Completed native sign-in finalizes profile setup
without altering permissions or workspace trust.

Managed Claude profiles inherit behavioral settings from `~/.claude/settings.json`,
including permission default, model and effort, at launch/resume. Profile overrides
remain. Auth, API keys, endpoints, directory overrides and other hooks are not
copied. OAuth, token renewal, limits and connectors stay native.

**Permissions → Change…** sets provider defaults or bypass for future launches
and resume on that host. Explicit launch flags take precedence. Current agents
continue unchanged; account labels describe launch settings, not every running
session's effective permissions. Bypass maps to Codex full access without sandbox,
Claude `bypassPermissions`, Kimi Never Ask/`--auto` and DeepSeek's native
`danger-full-access`. The CLI is `hgs [@host] account permissions ID --mode
provider|bypass`. Permissions do not accompany copied sign-in credentials.
Resident legacy DeepSeek bridges also support this mode through the official
authenticated web API, without restarting the host or changing other sessions.
Capability checks precede new binding creation. If permission setup is not
confirmed, sending stays disabled; explicitly resume the same session to verify
and finish setup. A confirmed native preset is not applied again after an
uncertain acknowledgement. Already-running sessions keep their existing mode.

**Copy existing sign-in over SSH** copies Codex/Kimi credentials and necessary
provider/model settings into a new profile, without replacing another one or
copying history, tools or hooks. Claude's system Keychain cannot be transferred:
sign in on the destination. Providers can require new sign-in even after copying.
**Remove from…** requires confirmation naming the account and machine. Native
history and active session ownership remain separate from catalog removal.

On macOS, HGS does not unlock Keychain. The per-user
`com.hgdev.hgs.user-session` service allows a same-UID HGS process started through
SSH/tmux to join the existing graphical security session before Claude login,
inspection or launch. It passes system session authority, not passwords or tokens,
starts on demand and exits after a minute idle. A logged-in desktop session is
required; screen lock differs from logout. If Keychain is actually locked in that
session, unlock it there. Authentication diagnostics distinguish these cases.

<a id="deepseek"></a>

## Official DeepSeek Harness

The native adapter is pinned to `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2`. Install it on the
agent host, sign in and choose **DeepSeek Harness** in New session:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.0-rc.2
hgs account login native-dsh
hgs dsh /path/to/project --new -n work
```

Zerus launches the official native engine and its tools, access rules and history.
A versioned adapter connects its Session Controller through a private Unix socket.
The official web host uses a separate `hgs` profile through `--patch`; sign-in and
secrets stay in `DSH_HOME`. The web endpoint is loopback-only; remote access uses
SSH. `~/.npm-global/bin` is discoverable from service and SSH launches.

A new session waits for its first message. API-key `deepseek-official` connections
work independently of account sign-in. If `deepseek-account` needs login, Activity
shows **Sign in** and keeps the draft until native authorization finishes.

**Native UI** embeds the official web interface beside Activity and opens the
host workspace's native session list, including sessions created through Zerus.
Navigation preserves its screen and draft. The header can also open it in a
browser. Questions and approvals for Zerus-managed sessions remain in Activity;
**Respond in Activity** points there when needed. Native cookie exchange supplies
authentication, and ports/tunnels are discovered automatically. Embedded cookies
and cache are memory-only. Qt WebEngine is required.
`hgs native-ui SESSION --json` returns a private connection URL containing a token;
keep that output private.

Activity supports creation, messages/images, busy-session submission, questions,
approvals, per-session model/effort, pause/resume, rename, goals, todos and child
views. Request receipts prevent duplicate submission. Uncertain delivery requires
inspection. Model changes do not replace profile defaults. Stopping one session
does not terminate neighboring agents or the shared host. Closing Zerus leaves
the host running; Forget retains native history. Linux user systemd runs the host
in an independent scope so GUI service restart cannot kill the engine.

Native fork, global DeepSeek history search, schedule management and account
transfer are currently handled in Native UI. Native context reset awaits a
supported Session Controller operation. Other harness versions need contract
verification; updates never restart live hosts or agents automatically.
`python3 tests/test_dsh_native.py -v` exercises the official engine with a local
keyless model, covering history, lifecycle, questions, settings and browser login.

## Automatic recovery

**Settings → Automatic recovery** shares rules for temporary overload, rate limits
and network failures. Automation is off by default. Each class has its own delays:
`15, 30, 60, 300, -1` stops after four attempts; `15, 30, 60, 0` repeats the previous
60-second delay indefinitely after the first two attempts; `-1` alone does nothing.
Small jitter is applied. Class counters persist within an episode when errors change.

Native agent retries finish first. Claude, Codex and Kimi receive an explicitly
marked `[HGS automatic recovery]` continuation in the same conversation; HGS does
not replay the original request or tool command. The newer DeepSeek adapter retries
the failed model request; an older host uses continuation messages. Sign-in,
balance, quota and context exhaustion require manual action. Questions, new input,
Stop, session termination and identity changes cancel waiting; a native draft
blocks delivery. Unknown providers do not receive automatic input.

Provider failures replace Working or Compacting with a specific state such as
**Usage limit reached**, **Model at capacity** or **Sign-in failed** and appear
under **Needs attention**. Activity explains the stopped turn and offers
**Open Terminal** and, for exhausted quota, **Refresh usage**. Restore account
access or wait for the reset, then explicitly send a message to continue. Drafts
are kept; refreshing usage never retries a turn. Account percentages alone do
not change a running agent's state. Failed refreshes and offline snapshots are
labeled as last reported usage.

Codex failures come from the exact conversation's native error journal and
structured failed turn completions, including compaction failures. Tool output
and quoted error examples cannot change the session state. New native progress
clears the failure; changing the account counter alone does not.

A chip in the toolbar above the message field shows the countdown; its popover
shows the attempt number, **Attempts**, **Retry now** and **Cancel retry**. Retry now respects a known Retry-After. Policy edits apply to new
episodes; already scheduled episodes retain their delays. Disabling recovery
cancels automatic continuation. Uncertain delivery stops the episode rather than
sending Enter again.

An independent `hgs-recovery.service` / `com.hgdev.hgs-recovery` worker runs without
GUI. Custom installs can run `hgs recovery worker`. Episodes and receipts live on
the agent host under `sessions/recovery/`, guarded by policy revision and a single
executor lock. CLI operations are `hgs [@host] recovery get|set|sync|action`, with
JSON writes on stdin. Adapters register explicitly in `src/state/recovery.rs`.

Open Zerus clients synchronize policy versions over HGS/SSH every 15 seconds;
offline machines catch up later and executors keep their saved local policy.
Revision and writer identity establish deterministic order. Saving a stale form
requires Reload. No external cloud service is involved.

<a id="processes"></a>

## Processes launched by agents

**Processes** is off by default; enable it in **Settings → Processes**. It appears
beside Activity and Terminal, or Native UI for DeepSeek. When disabled, its list,
count and output are not polled; normal Activity, fleet and account updates continue.

**Live shells / processes** shows verified shells and independent command trees.
Recorded tool calls appear separately, with completed history collapsed. Equal
command text does not prove that a tool record and OS tree are the same task.
Rows expose owner, state, elapsed time and available folder/progress/output. OS
trees show PID and child count; their stdout is not independently captured.
The active count uses the maximum of confirmed tool records and OS trees, not
the sum of overlapping sources. Unconfirmed records do not count as active.

| Agent | Observation and output | Targeted control |
|---|---|---|
| Claude | Hooks, Bash/tool_result, backgroundTaskId and native output files | Verified live OS trees |
| Codex | Hooks and rollout CommandExecution, including code-mode and write_stdin | Verified live OS trees |
| Kimi | Hooks, main/child process-task registry and tasks/ID/output.log | Verified live OS trees |
| DeepSeek | tools/execute and ctx.jobs in the native bridge | Session-owned native jobs |

**Stop selected** verifies every selected target, run, conversation and ownership
before dispatch. Native jobs also require host generation and job identity. OS
trees require PID/start-time and ancestry checks, use TERM and escalate the selected
tree to KILL after two seconds if needed. Linux uses PID handles; macOS rechecks
start times. The agent and neighboring trees are excluded. Stale generations and
offline snapshots cannot stop a newly reused target. Requests are sequential,
with no automatic retry; identity changes cancel unsent ones. **Stopping** remains
until completion is confirmed. Whole-turn Stop in Activity is a separate action.

`hgs [@host] processes SESSION --json` reads records. `--output ID` and `--stop ID`
require `--run RUN --conversation ID`; native jobs additionally use
`--generation GENERATION`. Archives accept `--archive ID` for read-only history.
Older DeepSeek hosts retain history until their ordinary next start; live registry
and targeted stopping need the newer bridge. GUI updates do not restart hosts.

Default intervals are 2.5 seconds for open Processes, 30 seconds for background
counts, ten seconds for Unconfirmed output and 0.5 seconds before a loading
indicator. Detailed polling covers only the selected visible session. Output is
read only for the visible selected command, immediately on opening, and refreshed
on meaningful state/output changes. Disabling the feature uses
`hgs inspect --skip-processes`; explicit CLI reads remain available. Terminal/Native
UI inspection also follows the background interval. These reads use local state,
OS/native registry or SSH, never a model call.

Lost foreground hooks become Unconfirmed rather than staying Starting through
another command. Codex completion beyond the normal 8 MiB transcript window can
be read incrementally up to 16 MiB per poll and cached privately. Completion needs
the exact call ID in the verified conversation; absence of an event is not success.

## Terminal, SSH and clipboard

The built-in Terminal is a real PTY client attached to an existing tmux session,
locally or over SSH. It supports ANSI/VT, UTF-8, colors, fullscreen applications,
keys, selection, scrollback, paste and resize. Connect, Disconnect and Reconnect
change only that client. Closing the window detaches it and leaves the agent alive.
The client uses `hgs a SESSION --existing [--run-id ID]`; disappearance does not
restore a session automatically. Ordinary `hgs a SESSION` retains Saved restore
behavior. The vendored terminal engine is libvterm 0.3.3 under MIT; builds do not
download it. Rendering updates changed cells and the cursor rather than scanning
the full screen for every small change.

Dropping files into Terminal inserts paths without Enter. Remote drops first copy
files to the session host, limited to eight files, 10 MiB each and 20 MiB total.
Changing tab, session or connection during transfer cancels insertion.
**Open externally** and **Copy connect command** retain access from other clients.

If SSH drops, tmux on the remote host continues running. Reattach normally. If the
local tmux server dies, its sessions are gone; `hgs` restores the terminal mode and
reports this instead of leaving the alternate screen active:

```text
hgs: the tmux server died; terminal restored, sessions on this box are gone
```

A client failure while tmux remains alive does not trigger terminal reset sequences
that could corrupt the normal screen. Saved conversation bindings can still be
restored after server loss, but tmux is not a reboot-persistence mechanism.

The optional `tmux.conf` binds Ctrl-V to `hgs paste` for the remote image clipboard
bridge. At attach, `HGS_CLIENT` records the viewing host; an SSH hop forwards it
through `--client`. The session host fetches PNG from the client's `hgs clip`, puts
it in its own native clipboard and forwards Ctrl-V so the agent reads its usual
clipboard. Local sessions need no SSH. Errors still forward the key, with a short
status and a best-effort line in `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/hgs/paste.log`.
The log is not rotated automatically. Clipboard synchronization is specific to
the image-paste bridge, not general desktop synchronization. A remote host needs
a working graphical clipboard environment; choose the viewing peer explicitly
when several clients attach to the same session.

New sessions created through a peer obtain the host's graphical environment rather
than inheriting an unrelated SSH display. Terminal client environment and macOS
graphical security context are handled separately from agent conversation state.

### External terminal modes

Linux defaults to Konsole with `auto`, `tab`, `window` or `clipboard`. Without
Konsole in `PATH`, it opens the desktop's default terminal through
`xdg-terminal-exec`, or `x-terminal-emulator` on Debian and Ubuntu; the
Konsole-specific `tab` and `window` modes do not apply there. macOS offers Terminal.app or clipboard. A custom
`--terminal` template substitutes `{cmd}`.
Konsole tab insertion needs its security-sensitive D-Bus API and an available
window; automatic mode may open a new window when a usable tab is unavailable.
Enabling that API grants other session-bus processes control of terminal tabs.
Terminal.app remains the native macOS backend; alternate terminal bundles need a
supported explicit launch template, not an executable path guessed from a bundle.

Clipboard mode copies the shell-safe connect/restore command instead of launching
a terminal. Explicit **Open terminal** still opens one without changing that mode.
Linux uses its desktop clipboard; macOS uses the native clipboard. New-session
**Open terminal window** remains an independent preference.

The tray config lives at `~/.config/hgs/tray.conf` unless overridden. CLI flags win
at startup; a later tray-menu selection takes effect immediately and writes the
config for subsequent runs. A later launch with the same explicit flag wins again.

<a id="installation"></a>

## Installation, configuration and diagnostics

See [installation.md](installation.md) for dependency and install commands.
`~/.local/bin/hgs` must exist on peers because SSH calls use that path.
Configurations are data assignments, not executable shell scripts:

```sh
HGS_SELF="workstation"       # aliases that identify this host
HGS_PEERS="macbook build-01"  # SSH aliases to poll and target
HGS_TAB=1                    # enable terminal title updates
HGS_TAB_COLORS="macbook=#80ff80"
```

The CLI config is `~/.config/hgs/config`; `HGS_CONFIG_DIR` and `HGS_STATE_DIR` permit
isolated setups. Runtime storage, `HGS_*` variables and application/service IDs
stay compatible with existing installations. Source is [MIT](../LICENSE); see
[third-party notices](../THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md) for dependency licensing.

The GUI installer updates only Zerus and its desktop integration. It never
restarts native agents, tmux servers or DeepSeek hosts. Use
`HGS_TRAY_RESTART=0 ./tray/install.sh` to stage a GUI update while keeping a running
workspace and its unsaved drafts. The new UI starts on the next launch.

Linux installs the binary under `~/.local/bin`, a systemd user service under
`~/.config/systemd/user` and a launcher under `~/.local/share/applications`.
The launcher is not a second autostart entry. The service belongs to
`graphical-session.target`, restarts after crashes and does not loop on exit code 4
(system tray unavailable). Compare `systemctl --user status hgs-tray.service` and
`journalctl --user -u hgs-tray.service` when startup fails.

On macOS the installer uses Qt/Homebrew, builds and ad-hoc-signs an app bundle,
and installs it under `~/Applications/hgs-tray.app` with
`~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hgdev.hgs-tray.plist`. A graphical login is required
for the tray. Signing precedes bundle replacement; matching code hashes avoid
unnecessary replacement. Ad-hoc signing is not a Developer ID distribution
signature. LaunchAgent crash recovery is independent of native agent engines.

```sh
launchctl list | grep com.hgdev.hgs-tray
~/Applications/hgs-tray.app/Contents/MacOS/hgs-tray --selftest --hgs ~/.local/bin/hgs
```

A PID means the agent is running; `-` means it exited and the next field is its last
exit code. `mac-install.sh` requires an explicit target SSH alias, installs source
under `~/.local/src/hgs` and builds on that host. `--no-tray` updates only the CLI.
No reverse connection is created by default. Explicit peer setup uses
`HGS_MAC_PEER`, `HGS_MAC_PEER_HOST` and optional `HGS_MAC_PEER_USER`,
`HGS_MAC_PEER_KEY`, `HGS_MAC_PEER_COLOR` through local configuration.

| Desktop option | Purpose / default |
|---|---|
| `--hgs PATH` | CLI executable, normally discovered through PATH |
| `--local-poll MS` | Local tray polling, 2000 ms |
| `--peer-poll MS` | Peer tray polling, 60000 ms |
| `--terminal TEMPLATE` | External terminal launcher with `{cmd}` |
| `--icon-color COLOR` | Override tray mark/counter foreground |
| `--open-mode MODE` | Linux auto/tab/window/clipboard; macOS terminal/clipboard |
| `--selftest` | Headless hgs connectivity check |
| `--sessions` | Open the workspace |

A single-instance socket forwards repeated launches to the running GUI.
The version appears in the rail and Settings. Closing a workspace never owns
agent process lifetime. Local machine settings, credentials, runtime journals and
personal connection values belong outside the repository.

## JSON and external clients

```sh
hgs ls --json --local
hgs inspect codex/sample-project/review
hgs inspect codex/sample-project/review --after 123
hgs @mac inspect claude/sample-project/review
hgs @mac dirs '~'
```

`ls --json --local` is one host snapshot without SSH; an empty tmux server returns
an empty array. A minimal shape is:

```json
{
  "host": "workstation",
  "ok": true,
  "projects": {"sample-project": "/workspace/sample-project"},
  "sessions": [{
    "name": "claude/sample-project/review",
    "cmd": "claude",
    "project": "sample-project",
    "tag": "review",
    "attached": 1,
    "clients": ["/dev/pts/2"],
    "created": 1787840176
  }]
}
```

Tracked live sessions add resumability and activity. Saved sessions use
`state: paused|stopped`, zero attached clients and an empty clients array.
Archives add `archive_id` and `archived_at`; missing state remains compatible with
older live-session snapshots. `ok: false` indicates an unavailable host.

`inspect` includes conversation, phase/activity, prompt/last message, tools,
subagents, events and cursor. Initial reads return recent events; `--after` advances
the cursor. Reset it when conversation ID changes. `history_truncated` discloses
journal limits; `tracked: false` identifies an unbound session. Folder/Git fields
include `cwd`, `cwd_source`, `cwd_canonical`, `git_root`, `git_common_dir`, branch,
worktree, detached state and metadata status. Git metadata has a bounded read and
15-second cache, independent of pause eligibility.

Subagent count fields distinguish active, completed, total, completeness and
source; unknown totals are null. Up to six active/unreviewed previews accompany
the available full roster. Profile groups without individual IDs remain groups.

`hgs [@host] send SESSION --json` accepts stdin containing a UUID `request_id`,
`text`, `expected_run_id`, `expected_conversation_id` and optional attachments
`{name, mime, data_base64, reference?}`. Unique `[Image #1]` / `[File #2]` references
place attachments at their first marker; otherwise they append. IDs come from a
fresh inspection. `status: submitted` confirms native input delivery, not a model
reply. Saved receipts make identical requests idempotent. An uncertain result
needs manual inspection before another request. `agent_id` is supported only for
verified DeepSeek continuable children. Questions carry request identity/hash
through `pending_questions`; answers use the exact unchanged request.

## Validation

Use [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for standard checks. Integration tests
use synthetic fixtures and isolated tmux servers; do not run them against live
agent state. A separately installed native CLI or real desktop may be required.

```sh
cargo build --locked
cargo test --locked
HGS_TEST_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/hgs" bash tests/test_hgs.sh
HGS_TEST_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/hgs" python3 tests/test_pause.py
HGS_TEST_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/hgs" python3 tests/test_accounts.py
HGS_TEST_BIN="$PWD/target/debug/hgs" python3 tests/test_account_lifecycle.py
```

On macOS, the last suite can also verify SSH/tmux entry into the graphical security
session and needs the installed HGS desktop session service. The Mach protocol
can be checked without accessing Keychain:

```sh
clang -Wno-deprecated-declarations tests/test_macos_session_protocol.c \
  -framework Security -framework CoreFoundation -lbsm -o /tmp/hgs-session-protocol-test
/tmp/hgs-session-protocol-test
```

Process coverage includes exact call identity, background tasks, stale generations,
independent output cursors, targeted stopping and offline/read-position behavior.
Native DeepSeek tests use a local keyless model rather than paid API requests.
