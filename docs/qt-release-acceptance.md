# Zerus Next release acceptance and Qt removal

Owner: `zerus-5wmh.66.8.1` (G6). Basis: the
[retirement inventory](superpowers/specs/2026-10-29-qt-retirement-inventory.md),
especially its responsibility tables, migration contract and G1–G7 gates.
Owner scheduling decision (2026-11-02): installed acceptance uses the owner's
**main accounts and existing canonical install route**, with no separate test
account. **macOS runs first once the source admission gates below are merged**;
Mac GUI/native checks need no separate owner window. **Arch GUI acceptance is
deferred until the owner reschedules it.** Windows remains on va-kids using the
owner's main account; the inventory's unreachable-PC note is historical.
**Full platform acceptance remains pending.** Recorded subchecks do not establish
platform acceptance; a merged PR or a private fixture pass does not check a box.
Qt deletion stays a draft until the coordinator accepts the
results for all three platforms; do not deploy the deletion branch for these tests.

For each platform, record the exact Next and last-Qt release/source, installed
`--build-info`, package/artifact identity and installer route in the acceptance
PR comment. Fill every row with PASS or a linked blocking bead and the actual
steps/results. Keep logs bounded and redact account/message/device data. Preserve
Qt settings, drafts, outboxes and connector journals; never restart agents, tmux
or a live DeepSeek host, and do not touch unrelated services. Close every window
opened by a run and avoid notification spam. Explicit confirmations remain
required for destructive UI. A clean-install or default-OFF subcase needs genuinely
clean/default state: never clear or reseed the owner's existing state to manufacture
it, and leave the subcase pending if it cannot be observed on the main account.

## Linux — arch

**GUI/installed acceptance is deferred until the owner reschedules it**, even
when the source gates have merged. Then use the owner's main account and the
maintained canonical AUR/package or `tray/install.sh` route. Staging prefixes are
file checks only, not installed acceptance. Do not install a test binary by hand.

| Pending check | How to verify | Coverage / owner |
|---|---|---|
| [ ] Clean install | Check a genuinely clean canonical install of the exact Next package on the owner's main account; open About and compare GUI/CLI identities. Inspect package contents/dependencies for Qt/KF6/WebEngine absence; confirm accounts/projects are initially empty. | G5 `.66.7.1`, [#867](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/867); linux-shell-u |
| [ ] Upgrade with agents running | From the last Qt release, keep a known terminal/native session and an unsent draft open; record exact session/run/conversation identities. Upgrade through the maintained installer/updater, reopen that same session and verify identity, jobs, terminal and draft survived without a restart. | [#886](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/886), G2 `.66.4`, G6 `.66.8` |
| [ ] One-time import | Compare selected Qt settings, collapsed rows, folder split, cleanup choices, window geometry, drafts and read marks. Change a Next preference, restart twice and roll back/forward: no reseed, source writes or replay. Malformed/partial families remain recoverable. | G3 `.66.5.2.1`, `.66.5.3`, [#870](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/870) |
| [ ] Service registration/readiness | Inspect the generated user unit and `hgs desktop status --json`: one owned service, independent background readiness, graphical-session environment imported. Close Next; catalog/details, presence and durable read delivery continue. Custom units refuse overwrite. | `.66.3.27`, [#886](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/886), [#898](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/898), `.66.3.31` |
| [ ] Notifications/clicks | With Next closed, produce one scoped attention event; get one Freedesktop alert and badge, click into the exact run, then test stale/withdrawn click refusal and Wayland activation. Lock/idle does not invent activity. | `.66.3.30.1/.3/.4`, [#940](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/940) in-process service Linux adapter, [#907](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/907) ledger, [#914](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/914) discovery; [#894](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/894) is extraction only; linux-shell-u/desktop-u |
| [ ] Tray/lifecycle | Check panel icon, primary click, menu, background start and second-instance routing; closing windows keeps service duties, Quit flushes drafts and does not stop agents. | G4 `.66.6`, `.66.3.31` |
| [ ] Terminal | Open an existing session and a folder terminal with spaces/non-ASCII paths; check exact argv, resize, paste and reattach after client exit. Never create a worktree by opening a dialog. | inventory “Terminal and process lifetime”; G7 `.66.2`, native terminal contracts |
| [ ] Voice/video | Explicitly choose microphone/camera; record, preview, cancel and transcribe a short synthetic message. Hide/Escape stops capture, private draft survives exit, and an uncertain delivery is not resent. | G2 `.66.4.5`, inventory “Voice, video and speech providers” |
| [ ] UI/durable parity | Exercise each inventory responsibility with its target owner: bounded Activity/archive/search/tasks pages, organization writes, creation/recovery, read marks and manual questions. Use the [installed client cutover runbook](#installed-client-cutover-on-linux-and-macos) for service and intent cases. Approval opt-in starts off; generic/agent callers cannot enable it. | G1–G4/G7; [#884](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/884), `.66.3.32`, `.66.3.35`, `.66.3.38` |
| [ ] Qt rollback | Before removal, use the maintained previous-version rollback. Require settled desktop revoke/drain before Qt starts; missing/unknown revoke refuses. Verify the exact agents, drafts and original settings still exist; then return through the maintained Next route. | `.66.3.31`, `tray/update-installed.py`; desktop-u |

Linux notification acceptance also requires the root service attachment
(`.66.3.30.11.2`, desktop-u) and activation/click handoff to the service-mode UI
(`.66.3.30.12`, linux-shell-u). The merged adapter's component fixtures do not
complete these routes or the native checks with Next closed. Keep this row pending
until the coordinator's maintained owner route verifies readiness, presentation,
click routing, stale/withdrawn refusal and Wayland behavior.

### Recorded Arch passive cutover subchecks — 2026-11-02

The admitted main-account run used the existing canonical source installation
`a1023d4142d1efcffada146d9d1ad68f9596e6a6`, not the Qt-deletion draft.
webkit-c held the display lock for its 18:53–19:01:45 MSK client checks;
migrate-u performed the nondisplay checks. The coordinator verified restoration
and closed the window. **These are scoped subchecks; every Linux platform
checkbox above remains pending.**

| Subcheck | Result | Actual evidence and limit |
|---|---|---|
| Installed identity and dependencies | PASS, existing source install | GUI/CLI image hashes match the installed provenance for `a1023d4`; GUI reports Tauri and `com.hgdev.hgs-tray`. Direct ELF dependencies and the resolved `ldd` closure contain no Qt/KF/WebEngine or missing libraries. This was not a clean install or a package transaction. |
| Existing service registration and IPC | PASS, passive scope | The maintained installer `--check` succeeds. The owned user unit has no drop-ins; its selected image/configuration/PID and actual Wayland, runtime-directory and session-bus environment agree. The same service serves schema 15 with IPC ready. This does not establish background readiness. |
| Custom-unit refusal | PENDING | No owner unit or drop-in was changed to manufacture a negative case. |
| Service-mode startup, explicit Rearm and restart | PASS, passive scope | Startup respected the native/rearm fence. The explicit UI Resume obtained service ownership at revision 13; normal Quit retained it, and a fresh service-mode GUI obtained its original Grant at revision 14. The UI remained unavailable with zero Fleet source rows and no GUI Fleet fallback; no background runtime started. |
| Native restore | PASS, passive prior runtime | Normal native startup found its original accepted, durable `native_takeover` receipt with `native_ready` and revoked/checkpointed/drained fields. Ownership returned to native revision 15 with current identity. This is not evidence that an active notification or delivery runtime drained. |
| Existing drafts and sampled process continuity | PASS, sampled scope | webkit-c retained byte-identical contents for 37 nonempty draft files and unchanged original PID/birth identities for 24 sampled agent/tmux processes through Quit/restart/native restore. This is not an all-process census or a Qt-upgrade result. |
| Existing preference import | PASS, handled-family subcheck | Nine schema-1 preference families are handled, three with zero source keys; no family is quarantined. All nine recorded source hashes match the current Qt file. Its bytes, mtime and file identity, all nine family records and the original seed are unchanged after cutover/restart/restore; layout presentation metadata is present. No reseed or source write was performed. |
| Current approval policy and generic agent refusal | PASS, passive subcheck | The existing policy stayed OFF. A generic agent-shell OFF request was refused with `handoff_required`. This proves that passive refusal only, not active frontend authentication, ENABLE delivery or a clean default-OFF origin. |
| Active background readiness and UI-closed duties | BLOCKED: `.66.3.27.5` | The registered command is `hgs desktop serve` without `--background`; no maintained switch starts the active runtime. Ownership Grant/Rearm alone does not start it. Fleet, presence and read delivery therefore remain untested while the UI is closed. |
| Frozen transfer, raw host read and active approval delivery | BLOCKED: `.66.3.27.5` | No synthetic target or genuine mark was created. No transfer or exact-target raw host acknowledgement was inferred from the overlay, queue, IPC or ownership receipt. No approval ENABLE was submitted. |
| Service banner/click, active withdrawal and Qt rollback | BLOCKED: `.66.3.27.5` | No notification, active withdrawal/drain, Qt rollout or rollback was performed. |
| Optional-question preference and foreground suppression | KNOWN GAP: `.66.3.30.11.13` | The typed transport is not merged. These cases were excluded without failing unrelated passive subchecks. |
| Clean/default state and complete migration acceptance | PENDING | Existing owner state was never cleared or reseeded. Clean install, original default OFF, malformed-source recovery, last-Qt upgrade and rollback/forward idempotence remain unproved. |

The GUI returned through its maintained launcher with the same installed image
and native startup mode; the temporary mode flag was absent from both GUI and
manager. The desktop service retained its original PID and definition, remained
passive and IPC-ready, and kept approvals OFF. No install, service restart, unit
edit, notification, or agent/tmux/DeepSeek signal was performed. Opened test
windows were closed and webkit-c released the display lock. The coordinator then
resumed the rollout watcher; later replacements are outside this recorded run.

Selected nondisplay evidence is retained privately by migrate-u under
`.ci-build/migrate-u/arch-installed-acceptance-a1023d4/` (under 100 KiB at close).
webkit-c's bounded commands, receipts, draft/process comparisons and restoration
are in `.ci-build/installed-cutover-20261102/ledger.json` (8,110 bytes) and adjacent
selected records. Exact private identities stay there; this document contains no
message bodies or owner settings dump.

### Recorded second Arch active-service window — 2026-11-03

Tracked by `zerus-5wmh.66.8.3`. The owner rescheduled this window and performed
the maintained foreground mode switches. Physical checks used the existing
source installation `5e4427f6792e4d0b9315e470cf23f85e69a8aa65`, reporting Tauri,
`com.hgdev.hgs-tray` and `0.47.1-preview.design-polish.5e4427f`, with
`sourceDirty:false`. The earlier `926b046b35f96594e2581a31ebce000a2bda84ab`
preflight was read-only and superseded before effects; its observations do not
qualify the later installation. **This window remains incomplete; every platform
acceptance checkbox is unchanged.** It was not a package qualification, last-Qt
upgrade, Qt type rollback or Qt removal.

| Subcheck | Result | Actual evidence and limit |
|---|---|---|
| Installed identity | PASS, existing source install | Selected CLI/GUI hashes and running image identities matched the exact `5e4427f6` installation before effects; the restored Native GUI used the same installed image. No clean install or package transaction was tested. |
| Maintained background selection and readiness | PASS, active runtime scope | The owner's foreground maintained helper selected background successfully. Actual service status showed `background_service`, writers enabled, two live Fleet sources, presence `published`, reads ready, and the Linux attention host ready with its attachment restored and outbox pending zero. Automatic approvals stayed OFF. These are readiness observations, not a delivered read, banner or click. |
| Service GUI restart/reconnect | FAILED: `zerus-yqie` | Automatic reconnect failed after restart. The owner's manual Retry connected. This failed subcheck remains assigned to menu-c; a manual connection does not qualify automatic recovery or last-known catalog behavior. |
| Service session/project grouping | FAILED: `zerus-gpz3` | After Retry, the owner observed all 47 sessions in Inbox. Source diagnosis found service baseline/delta rows projected with an empty `row.machine`, while Native mode fills the local host or configured peer alias used by membership keys. The coordinator independently confirmed authoritative shared projects and memberships intact; no project deletion occurred. The fix and rerun belong to menu-c. |
| Retained Qt/Settings report | WARNING: `.66.5.11` | The retained Qt file's mode 0644 and the checkpoint's `0o077` refusal provide a sufficient source/metadata cause for the report warning; its detailed native error code was not directly observed. This independent best-effort Staged report neither gates the live connection nor imports or deletes live projects. No source permissions were changed to bypass it; complete G3 acceptance remains pending. |
| Owner Quit and maintained passive restoration | PASS, original helper transition | After owner-confirmed normal Quit, the original GUI invocation exited successfully. The same maintained helper completed passive restoration using its retained original `ARCH_G6_ROLLBACK_ID`, with no pending transition/restart. A post-restart lookup of that original revoke returned `writer_epoch_changed`; it was retained as a refusal, never upgraded into a successful receipt or replayed. |
| Fresh Native restoration | PASS, scoped restoration | Current status showed passive mode, no background runtime, writers disabled and no service owner epoch. The prior ABSENT startup flag was restored before one maintained Native GUI launch. A fresh authenticated `ARCH_G6_NATIVE_TAKEOVER_ID` was accepted and durable, with `native_ready`, revoked/checkpointed/drained, current Native revision 50 and current identity. This separate fresh takeover does not change the earlier revoke lookup's result. |
| Managed draft files and sampled processes | PASS, sampled continuity | All 174 managed regular nonempty Qt/Next draft-file hashes were unchanged, with none added, missing or changed. All 24 sampled original process birth identities and images were unchanged. This does not prove unsent-content semantics or an all-process census. The retained Qt source hash was unchanged from the regression probe. |
| Native project presentation after restore | PENDING, owner observation | The actual Native GUI was restored at the exact installed `5e4427f6` image with the service-mode environment absent. The owner's visual confirmation of project presentation was still pending when this ledger was prepared. |
| Remaining delivery/native/platform cases | INCOMPLETE | No deliberate Post/banner/click, synthetic read mark, exact-target host ACK or approval ENABLE was submitted. Terminal, voice/video, destructive-review refusal, complete migration, Qt rollback and package acceptance were not qualified by this window. G6 requires a rerun after the reviewed menu-c fixes and the remaining native cases. |

Root made no project/source edits or source-permission changes during the
physical window. Approvals remained OFF. Normal GUI Quit and the maintained
service transitions did not restart or signal the sampled agents, tmux or a
DeepSeek host. The shared display lock is released; the owner
visual observation above remains pending. These later active results do not
rewrite the scope or blockers of the historical 2026-11-02 passive run.

Evidence is retained privately under `.ci-build/g6-arch-5e4427f6/`; historical
read-only preflight records remain under `.ci-build/g6-arch-926b046b/`. Private
request UUIDs and process identities remain in those records; the stable labels
above identify their roles without publishing their values. Installed image

### Recorded Arch reconnect/grouping retry — 2026-11-03

This separate retry belongs to `zerus-5wmh.66.8.3` and product task
`T-i0p1w7`. Physical checks used the exact installed source
`5c11005546fc8bd0c6a2224acb81eacb5a21e0d9`, including
[#1124](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/1124) and
[#1128](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/1128). **The reconnect and project
presentation retry passed; broader G6 remains open and all platform checkboxes
are unchanged.**
The preceding `5e4427f6` failures and its pending historical observation are
unchanged; the results below apply to this new installed source only.

| Subcheck | Result | Actual evidence and limit |
|---|---|---|
| Installed identity and controlled GUI start | PASS, source-install scope | Selected CLI/GUI hashes matched installed provenance for `5c110055`, with clean source identity. The coordinator paused the rollout watcher; the original display lock was held. Owner-confirmed normal Quit ended the prior GUI with exit 0. The prior ABSENT startup flag was saved, only the service-mode flag was set to `1`, and one maintained service-mode GUI was started with its original process birth and unit invocation pinned. |
| Ownership after owner Resume | PASS, scoped Grant/current identity | After one owner Resume, the fresh lookup of `ARCH_G6_RETRY_GRANT_ID` found an accepted, durable `grant` result at revision 56. Its lookup retained `definitive:false`; the accompanying current snapshot independently showed Service revision 56, current identity and `rearm_required:false`. This Grant request is not relabeled as a Rearm request. |
| Maintained background switch and automatic reconnect | PASS, owner-confirmed retry | The owner's foreground Konsole call to the maintained helper succeeded for the same configuration: selected/running background mode, IPC ready, no pending transition/restart. After the service restart, the same original GUI automatically reconnected without Retry. The owner confirmed all 47 sessions and their projects in place. This qualifies the observed restart path for `zerus-yqie` and grouping path for `zerus-gpz3`, not every recovery case. |
| Background runtime and native frontend | PASS, readiness scope | Final status at service generation 66 and new service epoch `ARCH_G6_RETRY_SERVICE_EPOCH` showed writers enabled, local and Mac Fleet sources live, presence writer active, reads ready, automatic approvals OFF/disabled, and the Linux attention host ready with its attachment restored and outbox pending zero. The same original GUI's frontend observation remained `live_next` with its unchanged `ARCH_G6_RETRY_FRONTEND_INSTANCE`; the observer's `authority:false` did not grant mutation permission. This is readiness evidence, not notification or exact-target read-delivery acceptance. |
| Initial passive view and migration warning | OBSERVED / WARNING, G3 remains open | Before a live baseline, the fresh passive GUI initially showed a zero/skeleton view; this did not establish deletion. The retained migration-review notice associated with the Qt 0644 source remained visible. [#1133](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/1133) was not installed in the attested `5c110055` run. The independent report warning does not overturn the later owner-confirmed project placement. |
| Duplicate new-session placeholder | SEPARATE BUG: `zerus-zckh` | A duplicate placeholder for a newly created session was reported separately to menu-c. Root did not create or exercise a new session to test it; this ledger does not qualify its fix. |
| End state requested by owner | PASS, background intentionally retained | The owner requested staying in background mode. The manager flag therefore deliberately remains `1`, changed from its prior ABSENT state; the registered service remains background. The maintained updater through the existing GUI unit preserves that startup mode and service selection. No passive or Native restoration was performed in this successful retry. The window END was reported and the original display lock released normally; documentation follow-up does not hold rollout or the watcher. |
| Remaining native/platform acceptance | INCOMPLETE | No deliberate Post/click, approval ENABLE, synthetic read mark or raw host ACK was submitted. Qt type rollback/removal and package qualification were not performed. Full G3, delivery/click, terminal, voice/video, destructive-review and broader G6 cases remain open. |

Selected records are retained privately under `.ci-build/g6-arch-5c110055/`.
Stable role labels above replace private request UUIDs, service epochs and
process identities; no private project/session names or contents are published.
The installed image SHA-256 values were:

### Remaining G3 source work at this run

The whole `.66.5` migration is still incomplete. The preference/organization and
Windows-folder callers are merged through [#870](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/870).
The separate active Next pending-read transfer is wired by
[#973](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/973),
[#992](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/992) and
[#999](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/999).
The remaining Qt/interim source adapters and `migration::Bundle`/`Publisher`
still lack production discovery/capture/publication callers: their presence and
tests do not produce a complete private import/quarantine record.

migrate-u owns this remaining work with desktop-u's handoff seam: discover the
managed sources, freeze and freshly recheck their actual writers/snapshots, then
publish bounded immutable evidence using the existing adapters and publisher.
Preserve original identities and unknown/partial state without replay. This is
several focused source PRs (`.66.5.2.1`, `.66.5.2`, `.66.5.4`), and blocks the
complete one-time-import and upgrade acceptance rows. The completed service
read/approval implementation `.66.3.29` is separate; its closure does not close
G3 or installed acceptance.

### Historical creation source capture

In service mode, the original Next creation worker captures its managed
`creations.json` before its first **service-mode** load, recovery normalization
or journal write. A native-mode run still loads its journal without this capture.
The fixed private `creation-preload-v1` slot contains the durable capture UUID,
original source object/stamp/hash, exact bytes and a read-back receipt. Raw input
is limited to 8 MiB and the existing schema-1 decoder's 128 operations; metadata
leaves are limited to 64 KiB. Nothing lists other source files or starts a second
queue. The original worker proceeds only after the complete capture is synced,
read back and rechecked. A verified missing source is not-applicable, not an
empty imported journal.

Unsupported, oversized, unreadable or changed input keeps that original legacy
owner paused, including Hide/Show/Stop and writes. Its redacted
`retained_source_import.creations_capture` status is visible beside the
independent Qt/Settings report; normal service Retry wakes that same worker.
Failed/partial files remain for review, with the original capture UUID; Retry
never overwrites a partial slot or adopts a newer source version. Connection,
Grant, watch/catalog, ownership Resume and the separate G2 actor stay available.
Do not clear the slot to manufacture a successful report.

On Unix the capture resolves the managed data folder once and pins that canonical
object for capture and the original legacy journal load/writes; symlinks through
home, `$XDG_DATA_HOME` and `.local/share` are supported.
The existing data folder must be owned by the user; a group-writable mode such as
0775 is preserved. The archive slot must remain user-owned and private (0700),
and source/archive leaves remain private, owned, single-link and no-follow. A
`creation_source_private_slot` refusal asks to check archive availability and
restore its private permissions before Retry; `creation_source_data_directory`
asks to check the managed data folder's availability and ownership.
`creation_source_unavailable` asks to check private file access/ownership (0600
on Unix) and review retained partial files before Retry. No permission
or source repair happens automatically.

These are endpoint identity rechecks, not an exclusive namespace hold. Deliberate
same-user rename-and-back between checks is outside this protection. Other users
in a shared writable data-directory group can rename the archive slot away, just
as they can the live journal; private leaves and rechecks do not make 0775 a
hostile-writer exclusion guarantee. Missing/replaced data remains unavailable and
never grants current coverage or effect authority.

After capture, normal live journal writes may resume. The archive is explicitly
historical pre-load data: a later source recheck validates the retained private
snapshot's native identity and raw hash, not today's mutable journal. It is not
Drained, current-source completeness, worker ownership or execution consent.
This exception does not relax the Qt/Settings source leases. The separate
creation report binds this exact capture ID once to the paired canonical service
configuration. It publishes the unchanged creation source and
an explicit historical provenance source through the existing Staged publisher;
its own `creations-retained-import-v1.json` retains the configuration, snapshot
reference, attempt and expected receipt. It never uses the Qt/Settings journal's
hash fields. Attempts/unknown results keep their original ID and are lookup-only.
A complete exact negative permits explicit Retry of the same record after fresh
snapshot validation. A confirmed local callback failure before the final record
write has its own durable `before_record` state: no final record was sent, so
explicit Retry may prepare that same identity again without inventing a receipt.
Missing, partial or lost child output never establishes this state. New records
use journal version 2, which also keeps `recorded_attempt`: before its final frame,
an attempt's callback durably records its receipt and `recorded_attempt`, under
the native lock and against that attempt's exact stored hash. An Attempted record
whose `recorded_attempt` is below its attempt, like a version 1 Attempted record
without a receipt, therefore proves that no final frame was sent, even after a
second metadata failure. Only an explicit Retry recovers it. It first looks up the
original ID: a matching record settles as published, and any other answer stays
lookup-only. It then revalidates the same snapshot and configuration, and fences
the record to `before_record` at the same attempt before reserving the next. The
fence changes the record's hash, so a still-pending original callback can no
longer record or send. A recorded gate, Unknown and every ambiguous state stay
lookup-only; a changed snapshot is quarantined. The native
metadata lock is explicitly unlocked before close, so a forked child's inherited
descriptor cannot prolong it. Retained SDK/helper/pipe resources
keep the shared report admission charged until actual completion. Publication
runs off the UI/legacy worker and never gates Grant, watch/catalog or Resume.
Capture/report success alone does not complete G3 or installed acceptance.

the owner's main-account evaluation. **Run Mac first after the source admission
gates merge; GUI/native acceptance may run at any time without a separate owner
window.** Close every opened window, never restart agents, tmux or DeepSeek hosts,
and avoid notification spam. Fresh and upgrade source installs default to Next via
`mac-install.sh`/`tray/install.sh` ([#904](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/904));
`HGS_MAC_GUI=client` remains an explicit selection before retirement. Keep the
existing privacy identity, signature, installed path and one verified rollback copy.

| Pending check | How to verify | Coverage / owner |
|---|---|---|
| [ ] Clean install | Check a genuinely clean canonical install of the exact signed/notarized `Zerus.app` on the owner's main account. Check bundle/CLI identity, signature/notary and package checks; no Qt frameworks/plugins. Cask install itself must not quit apps or start services. | G5 `.66.7.2`, [#871](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/871); macbundle-u |
| [ ] Upgrade with agents running | Upgrade last Qt via the maintained updater; verify exact running session/run/conversation, terminal/jobs and flushed drafts survive. Keep `com.hgdev.hgs-tray` and `~/Applications/hgs-tray.app`; no native-agent/tmux restart. | `.12.6`, [#871](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/871), `tray/update-installed.py` |
| [ ] One-time import | Check exported Qt defaults, layout/window bounds, drafts and read/attention marks; Next values win. Restart and rollback/forward without reseeding handled families; preserve original plist/export/store bytes. | G3 `.66.5.2.1`, `.66.5.3`, [#870](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/870) |
| [ ] Service registration/readiness | Through explicit `zerus-setup`, inspect the Aqua `com.hgdev.hgs-desktop` LaunchAgent and actual `desktop status`; close Next and verify background duties continue. Foreign/custom definitions are refused. | `.66.3.27.2`, [#882](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/882); macbundle-u/desktop-u |
| [ ] Notifications/clicks | With Next closed, post one service-owned alert through the signed host; check badge, exact-session click, stale click refusal and lock/idle behavior. Existing notification permission remains attached to the public app identity. | `.66.3.30.2/.3/.4`, [#913](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/913) signed host, [#907](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/907) ledger, [#914](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/914) discovery; [#891](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/891) is extraction only |
| [ ] Menu bar/lifecycle | Check icon/menu, reopen, Dock/menu-bar policy, second instance, Services/Hide/Show All and draft-safe Quit; agents and service remain independent. | G4 `.66.6`, `.66.3.31`, inventory native shell/menu rows |
| [ ] Terminal | Open exact session/folder in the configured Terminal path, with quotes/spaces/non-ASCII; accept only the expected Apple Events consent. Check resize/paste and session survival after UI exit. | inventory Mac terminal rows; native terminal contracts |
| [ ] Voice/video | Exercise real microphone/camera consent, short preview/transcription, cancel/hide and exit recovery. Check public privacy identity; never import an old device ID or replay uncertain delivery. | G2 `.66.4.5`, inventory media/privacy rows |
| [ ] UI/durable parity | Apply the same complete inventory responsibility walk as Linux, including bounded details/tasks, archived reads, creation recovery and default-off approvals with authenticated frontend-only enablement. Use the [installed client cutover runbook](#installed-client-cutover-on-linux-and-macos). | G1–G4/G7, `.66.3.31/.32/.35/.38` |
| [ ] Qt rollback | Use the retained complete Qt copy and original maintained updater before deletion; desktop revoke must settle before Qt starts. Verify settings/drafts/agents, then switch back to Next without a second import. | `.66.3.31`, updater rollback and defaults-snapshot checks |

## Installed client cutover on Linux and macOS

**Preparation only; no installed case below has been executed or accepted.**
Client procedure: `.66.3.31.1.1`, webkit-c; results and checkbox ledger: G6,
migrate-u. Select and record the exact current-integration candidate, never the
Qt-deletion draft. Run macOS first after all source gates below have merged,
without a separate owner window; the Linux installed run waits for the owner to
reschedule Arch acceptance.
The installer/service primitives below were checked at `c319a25f` and remain
unchanged at preparation baseline `1729e5c6`; recheck the selected candidate.

### Admission and isolation

Stop before execution until desktop-u's reviewed, authenticated service-mode
ownership grant/rearm (`.66.3.30.11.11`), its actual background native-host/click/drain
integration (`.66.3.30.11.12`) **and webkit-c's client companion
(`.66.3.30.11.11.1`) are merged**. Main-account use and Mac's anytime scheduling do
not waive these gates. Mac needs no separate owner window after they clear;
Arch still waits for the owner's rescheduling. At the preparation baseline:

- `background::Runtime` passes `None` to attention/activation polling and reports
  attention `ready:false`, `code:discovery_only`. Component adapter tests do not
  establish installed notification readiness.
- A retained revoke or handoff marker blocks background restart; complete old
  import evidence reports `delegation_required`. There is no public
  `desktop activate`, `resume` or `handoff` command. Insert desktop-u's actual
  reviewed grant/rearm UI/command sequence into the run record before proceeding,
  including the supported owned-service fault/passive/restore sequence used by
  the cases. If that sequence is unavailable, stop here.
  `desktop startup` is negative exclusion; `owner-status` reports no authority.
  Neither manager restart nor deleting markers can supply the missing grant.

Use the owner's main interactive account and its existing canonical install,
configuration, service and GUI route. Do not create or substitute a separate test
account, or start a second same-UID canonical switch with different config/profile
paths. Same-UID directories do not isolate Linux
`hgs-tray.service`/`hgs-desktop.service`, Mac
`com.hgdev.hgs-tray`/`com.hgdev.hgs-desktop`, or the canonical GUI socket.
A staging prefix, different development app ID, fake manager, altered unit label
or source test is not installed canonical authority.

Use the owner's actual main graphical login's HOME, runtime, bus and temporary
directory. File/profile overrides do not authenticate a frontend. Arch GUI
acceptance remains deferred. When the owner reschedules it, the coordinator
brackets that run with START/END and load snapshots, holds
`flock -w 1800 /tmp/zerus-arch-display.lock` for the display run, and stops if the
screen locks or sleeps. Never replace the lock or invent display/bus values.
Mac GUI/native acceptance needs no separate owner window after the source gates
clear. Close every opened window, never restart agents, tmux or a live DeepSeek
host, and avoid notification spam on either platform.

### Maintained install and trusted GUI start

Record exact GUI/CLI source, build/artifact identity, installed paths and prior
manager definitions before changing anything. For a main Dev source build,
`ZERUS_DEV_BUILD_NUMBER` must be that exact source's CI sequence. Preserve the
maintained preview identity when using the preview route.

| Platform | Maintained route on the owner's main account | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | Exact AUR/package route for the package row; source evaluation uses `bash ./install.sh`, then `HGS_LINUX_GUI=client bash ./tray/install.sh`. | The installer/updater owns replacement, drafts, rollback and service refresh. Root install can update connector/recovery/swarm/voice workers too; it is not a sandbox. |
| macOS | Native checkout: `bash ./install.sh`, then `HGS_MAC_GUI=client bash ./tray/install.sh`; the existing remote route is `HGS_MAC_GUI=client ./mac-install.sh "$MAC_ALIAS"`. | The alias must select the owner's main login. The SSH wrapper copies `tmux.conf` over `~/.config/tmux/tmux.conf` and runs `tmux source-file` to reload configuration; it does not restart tmux. Preserve the installed signed pair, existing signing identity and independent runner. |

Let the Mac installer perform `prepare-local-macos.py`, `sign-local-macos.py`
and `update-installed.py` in their maintained order. Register the **installed**
bundled service `hgs`, not a build/staging copy. The independent ordinary runner
may differ after signing; do not require its bytes to equal the bundled helper.
Published bundle setup is explicitly `"$APP/Contents/Resources/bin/zerus-setup"`;
cask installation alone is not setup, registration or readiness. Autostart is a
separate opt-in.

On both platforms, setting `HGS_INSTALL_PREFIX` makes the root installer stage
the CLI there and skip worker/service refresh. The Linux tray uses it for file staging; the
Mac tray ignores it. `DESTDIR` does not redirect these installers; it only
suppresses the root Linux desktop refresh. `HGS_TRAY_RESTART=0` is
not isolation: definitions can still be written and an absent GUI can start.
None of these paths supplies positive registration or a running canonical UI.

For the actual client cases, set exactly `ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE=1` for a
**new trusted GUI process** on the owner's main account. The flag is startup-only;
a second start forwards to the existing process and cannot change its mode.
Record the previous value or absence before setting it. These manager settings
apply to every later unit/agent launched in that login until removed or restored,
not just Zerus. With the original owned launcher present, after the old GUI's
normal draft-safe Quit:

```bash
# Linux, only after owner rescheduling, in the main login with its maintained GUI unit:
systemctl --user set-environment ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE=1
systemctl --user start hgs-tray.service

# macOS, after source gates merge, in the main Aqua login with its maintained GUI LaunchAgent:
launchctl setenv ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE 1
launchctl kickstart "gui/$(id -u)/com.hgdev.hgs-tray"
```

Do not force-restart a running GUI. If that original launcher is absent, G6 must
select the maintained trusted desktop launch path and verify the flag reached
the new process; do not fabricate a second definition. Launching from an
agent-descended shell or clearing `HGS_SESSION`/`HGS_RUN_ID` does not establish
consent or erase ancestry. Confirm the UI is actually in service mode before
any positive effect case. These main-account launch settings do not change the product default.

### Read-only source and manager preflight

`SERVICE_HGS`, `RUNNER_HGS`, `GUI`, `APP`, `CFG` and `STATE` below are the exact
absolute installed selections from that maintained route. On Linux the service
CLI is the installed CLI; on Mac it is the signed bundled helper. The GUI,
service definition and these probes must agree on configuration. Use the
registration preview's actual `readiness.argv` and `readiness.environment`;
preview itself is not registration or writer permission.

```bash
: "${SERVICE_HGS:?selected installed service CLI}" "${GUI:?selected installed GUI}"
: "${CFG:?selected config}" "${STATE:?selected state}"
"$GUI" --build-info
"$SERVICE_HGS" --version

desktop_cli() {
  env HGS_CONFIG_DIR="$CFG" HGS_STATE_DIR="$STATE" "$SERVICE_HGS" desktop "$@"
}
desktop_cli registration --json
desktop_cli status --json
desktop_cli owner-status --json

# Linux manager identity; run only the platform's applicable command:
systemctl --user show hgs-desktop.service --property=LoadState,ActiveState,MainPID,FragmentPath,DropInPaths --no-pager
# Mac Aqua manager identity:
launchctl print "gui/$(id -u)/com.hgdev.hgs-desktop"
```

A new binary's `--build-info` alone does not identify an already-running GUI.
Bind the actual new canonical PID/build/nonce to its original managed launch.
A CLI version string alone is not source/artifact proof. Keep Mac GUI, bundled
service helper and independent runner identities separate. Manager presence,
`ipc_ready` and `writers_enabled` do not mean every background duty is ready;
record lifecycle ABI/configuration/epoch/generation and each component's
`ready`/`code` plus the durable approval opt-in independently. Disabled policy
can be ready; degraded runtime can retain a true opt-in. No JSON readiness field
grants authority.

Use only the installed route's original helper when registration needs action:
Linux helper `--check`, `install [--no-start]`, `session`, and existing-only
`refresh` are in `scripts/install-linux-desktop-service.py` (`--hgs`, optional
absolute `--config-dir`/`--state-dir`). Mac helper takes the installed bundled
binary, `--runner-hgs`, `--check-only`; `--refresh-runner` preserves that backend
during CLI-only updates. `--restart` is only for an actual owned backend change.
Foreign/custom definitions refuse. No-start, headless/Aqua deferral, inactive
refresh or Linux exit 3 (PendingRestart) is not readiness. Unix has no
`desktop registration install/remove/status` command; those are Windows-only.
Never hand-start a second `desktop serve` as a repair.

### Linux background registration opt-in

The passive actor accepts the service-mode GUI's authenticated Grant/Rearm and
journals it without starting background workers. Complete that handoff first;
do not infer it from readiness. Then, from the owner's foreground terminal
**outside Zerus** in the current graphical login, use the maintained helper:

```bash
: "${DESKTOP_HELPER:?installed lib/zerus/install-linux-desktop-service.py from this candidate}"
python3 "$DESKTOP_HELPER" install --hgs "$SERVICE_HGS" \
  --config-dir "$CFG" --state-dir "$STATE" --mode background --json
python3 "$DESKTOP_HELPER" status --hgs "$SERVICE_HGS" \
  --config-dir "$CFG" --state-dir "$STATE" --json
desktop_cli status --json
```

Require the exact configuration and selected/running background mode separately
from fleet/presence/read/notification readiness. Missing/stale native Grant or
retained revoke refuses; perform authenticated frontend Rearm rather than
clearing files or launching a second service. Agent ancestry and `HGS_SESSION`/
`HGS_RUN_ID` refuse even if the environment is stripped in a child. The future
native Settings control uses this same helper contract; an agent cannot perform
the acceptance mode switch on the owner's behalf. Default install is passive;
normal refreshes preserve selection. Mac uses its own maintained route below;
Windows switching remains separate work. Linux results do not qualify them.

For Linux passive rollback, use `install --mode passive --json` with the same
selections **before** the GUI rollback. It durably retains one revoke UUID and
requires the original checkpointed drain before changing/restarting only
`hgs-desktop.service`. Record `last_revoke_request_id` on success. On uncertainty,
`status.transition.request_id` is the original ID; inspect it and resume only
that same passive transition. The native `desktop-revoke-hold-v1` child remains
held through the manager change and passive readiness; its matching release,
actual exit and pipe drain precede completion. Do not substitute a new revoke
UUID or return to background while it is pending. If a new authenticated Rearm
won before acquisition, use the documented explicit
[`cancel-rollback --request-id ORIGINAL_UUID`](linux-distribution.md#select-the-desktop-service-mode)
record-only recovery, then choose a new passive intent explicitly. Cancellation
requires a current Service grant and changes no native revoke, unit or manager.
The helper never restarts the GUI or agents.

### Mac background registration opt-in

Complete the actual service-mode GUI's authenticated Grant/Rearm against the
passive actor first. From the coordinator's genuine non-agent foreground
Terminal context in the current Aqua login, use the installed paired selections:

```bash
: "${APP:?canonical installed paired app}" "${RUNNER_HGS:?independent installed runner}"
MAC_DESKTOP_HELPER="$APP/Contents/Resources/setup/install-macos-desktop-service.py"
python3 "$MAC_DESKTOP_HELPER" "$SERVICE_HGS" --runner-hgs "$RUNNER_HGS" \
  --config-dir "$CFG" --state-dir "$STATE" --mode background --json
python3 "$MAC_DESKTOP_HELPER" "$SERVICE_HGS" \
  --config-dir "$CFG" --state-dir "$STATE" --status --json
desktop_cli status --json
```

Require the signed bundled service image and independent runner to stay selected,
and verify selected/running background mode separately from each component's
readiness. A private pty, stripped markers, SSH agent context or launchd-submit
does not replace the native caller/ancestor check. Missing/stale Grant, retained
revoke, no Aqua or a custom plist refuses; do not repair it by changing files or
starting another service. Only the owned desktop LaunchAgent reloads; neither
GUI nor agents restart. Normal GUI installs and CLI-only refresh preserve mode.

Before GUI rollback, use this helper with the same selections and `--mode
passive --json`. It retains one original revoke UUID and requires its exact
checkpointed runtime/resource drain and the original native hold through
bootout/rewrite/bootstrap and passive readiness. Require the matching release,
actual child exit and both pipe EOFs before transition completion. Record
`last_revoke_request_id`; on uncertainty, inspect `--status --json` and resume
only its original passive transition. Authenticated Rearm is required before
returning to background. No file clearing or new UUID substitutes for settlement.
If a newer Grant won before acquisition, or the original revoke never took
effect, the owner may use the Mac helper's `--cancel-rollback --request-id
ORIGINAL_UUID --json` only with a verified current Service grant. This cancels
registration metadata, with no manager/native ownership action; a later mode
choice is a separate explicit intent. See the [Mac mode contract](macos-distribution.md#explicit-desktop-service-mode).

### Client cases

Use fresh synthetic targets on the owner's main account. Record original exact
computer/session/run/conversation/reply/attention identities privately. Observe
the actual UI and its existing native responses without adding another batch
consumer or editing stores. Missing required observations leave a case BLOCKED
or INCOMPLETE, not inferred from a fixture, local overlay or aggregate count.
Use the selected host's bounded `hgs inspect "$TARGET_REFERENCE"` (or
`hgs @configured-alias inspect "$TARGET_REFERENCE"`) for a current journal-backed
main session. Require `read_observation.complete:true`, `freshness:"observed"`,
`source_state:"present"`, its content `generation` and host `observed_at` from
this invocation. Match **both** the top-level and `read_observation.target`
run/conversation to the captured original target; reference resolution alone may
follow a resumed conversation into a different run. The raw `read` fields must
cover the exact captured parts. They are stored by stable owner/conversation;
the observer reports the current run binding separately, not a new delivery
receipt. Retain the generation/time with the result. Missing raw fields, absent
storage, `complete:false`/unknown, changed target or unsupported provider keeps
the host-ACK subcase **BLOCKED**, even after a successful queue transfer. The
reader caps each source/binding file at 16 MiB and shares a one-second cooperative
budget; it does not list other sessions or change the marks. See
[raw shared-read inspection](reference.md#existing-session-snapshots). Do not substitute
an unbounded full listing or the GUI's local overlay.

| Case | Operator sequence | Required observation |
|---|---|---|
| New start and restart | Start the new trusted service-mode GUI through the maintained launcher. Open one synthetic session and a draft. Quit normally, prove its original UI/proxy exit, and reopen by the same trusted route. | One canonical GUI; matching new PID/build/source and service configuration; draft and exact session identities retained. Canonical responder remains, GUI writer Bootstrap/read/approval/notification/presence workers do not start. Closing the window/GUI leaves admitted service duties running; actual background readiness is required separately. |
| Unavailable, Retry and no fallback | Through G6's admitted owned lifecycle route, make only the owned canonical service unavailable; open/refresh the client and selected view, then restore it through the reviewed route and press **Retry now**/the view's Retry. | Explicit unavailable/last-known state, null/incomplete counts preserved, no second service or GUI Fleet/read/approval writer. Healthy sources are not re-baselined by Retry; a halted source/view can recover. New epoch/configuration retires old observation bindings. |
| Frozen read transfer and host observation | Before cutover, create a bounded set of genuine pending marks through the normal main-account UI. Start service mode, observe capture/import and its normal Retry. Keep exact original targets fixed until host observation. | Complete validated source digest/row count, native `pending_read_import` progress, original page/mark IDs and durable new/superseded receipts. `complete:true`/queued means transfer only; `delivered:false` is not host ACK. Through the exact-target `hgs [@configured-alias] inspect` observation above, separately read the current target's raw `read.conversation_id`, `read.reply_id`/`read.attention_signature`; require the same run/conversation and read fields that cover the captured parts. Missing observer or raw fields keeps host acknowledgement BLOCKED even when transfer completed. A changed/superseded target is not ACK of the old part. No GUI overlay or aggregate `pending:0` substitutes for this. Partial/unknown transfer retains frozen source and blocks fresh read delivery; no reseed or duplicate host dispatch. |
| Authenticated enable and confirmation | Record the main account's actual policy; verify default OFF only if that default state is present, otherwise leave that subcase pending without resetting consent. Turn ON only through Settings' existing confirmation; cancel once, then explicitly confirm with no unrelated/private questions eligible. Use one harmless synthetic one-time question to verify the intended flow and its journal, then turn OFF. | Cancel changes nothing. Confirm yields the native authenticated commit for the original logical UUID; ENABLE needs actual runtime/current writer readiness. Generic/agent toggle requests remain refused and do not change policy. No JSON role/confirmed flag, helper wrapper or direct audit Begin/Finish is an alternative. Journal paging/detail stays on the same configuration/epoch/journal/high-water. End with a confirmed durable OFF. |
| OFF while degraded | With confirmed ON and no pending intent, use the admitted owned service lifecycle to reach IPC-connected, stored `automatic_approvals:true`, approvals `ready:false` (for example its documented passive state after restart). Do not revoke/reset policy to manufacture the case. Click OFF. | OFF is available without another confirmation and commits through the authenticated writable route despite degraded/absent workers. ON remains disabled until ready and still requires confirmation. If that state cannot be reached through the admitted source route, leave this case blocked. |
| Uncertain result, lookup, no replay | During a controlled owned-service transition on the main account, submit one Approvals or Updates/Recovery configuration change through its existing UI and retain its original ID. Once the actual UI reports unconfirmed, use **Check result** while transport is unavailable, then after the service returns; check twice. For maintenance, retain the full update-and-recovery configuration; do not submit a second subsystem change while it is pending. | Unavailable lookup stays pending; the logical ID and operation do not change, and no new frontend mutation is sent. A durable receipt settles the original result. Only a later exact negative lookup after confirmed original child exit can settle not-applied; unverified exit remains pending. A fresh opposite intent is allowed only after settlement. If the transition produces only a definitive result/refusal, record that outcome and leave the unknown case incomplete; do not invent an unknown, replay, fake native authority or alter SQL/helper identity to obtain one. |
| Revoke, rollback and return to Next | First settle dangerous opt-ins OFF. Use the exact revoke/lookup below, then the updater's retained Qt rollback. Return through the maintained Next install plus desktop-u's actual fresh handoff/rearm. | Settled original revoke/configuration/writer epoch and actual component/native-resource drain precede Qt writers. Agents, drafts and original settings survive. Return does not reseed imports or replay old intents. Missing rearm source or unknown drain stops the return segment; no row/marker deletion or bare background restart. |

### Revoke and rollback commands

On Linux/macOS, use the appropriate maintained `--mode passive` command above
and retain its original revoke ID. A read-only lookup uses that same original
ID; it does not repeat revoke. Never create a second revoke while the helper
has a pending original transition.
The GUI rollback path is its actual installed path, not a staged copy.

```bash
: "${INSTALLED_GUI:?actual installed GUI}"
# Only if the helper result was uncertain, read its original receipt:
: "${REVOKE_ID:?original ID from the helper transition}"
printf '{"op":"revoke_status","request_id":"%s"}\n' "$REVOKE_ID" |
  env HGS_CONFIG_DIR="$CFG" HGS_STATE_DIR="$STATE" "$SERVICE_HGS" desktop request --json

# Only after the matching settled result and actual owned drain:
python3 tray/update-installed.py --rollback "$INSTALLED_GUI"
```

Require matching request/configuration and `accepted`, `durable`, `revoked`,
`checkpointed`. The explicit `applicable:false`, `handoff:none`, `revoked:true`,
`nothing_written` no-op is a separate no-work case; it does not prove that an
active runtime drained. Unknown keeps Qt stopped. PID disappearance, a native
Stop or `writers_enabled:false` alone is not original-resource drain. The
updater's quit/draft/type-switch/rollback checks remain mandatory. Recheck the
new candidate and actual fresh grant/rearm source before returning to Next.

### Record and restore the main account

Keep at most 64 KiB of redacted selected-field evidence per step and 1 MiB per
platform record set; these are evidence caps, not protocol changes. Overflow or
missing bytes/IDs is incomplete. Do not dump catalogs, SQL, marks files or
message bodies. Retain private exact IDs while using stable placeholders in
public results. Record:

- Candidate/installed identity and original manager/PID bindings; configuration,
  lifecycle epoch/generation, component readiness and durable opt-in separately.
- Frozen-source completeness and immutable transfer receipts separately from
  fresh host read observations; original mutation IDs and read-only lookups,
  including primary/secondary errors and original child/EOF/wait evidence where
  actually exposed. No missing field becomes a successful zero or empty list.
- Settled revoke, actual resource drain, original session/draft continuity and
  the admitted fresh rearm result. No source-only test counts as installed PASS.

G6 records outcomes in its result ledger; leave every platform checkbox pending
until that actual step passes and the coordinator accepts it. After the admitted
shutdown/revoke/drain sequence, restore the main account's prior launch environment:

- Linux: if previously absent, `systemctl --user unset-environment ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE`;
  if present, `systemctl --user set-environment "ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE=$PREVIOUS_MODE"`
  with its recorded previous value.
- macOS: if previously absent, `launchctl unsetenv ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE`;
  if present, `launchctl setenv ZERUS_CLIENT_DESKTOP_SERVICE "$PREVIOUS_MODE"`
  with its recorded previous value.

These commands affect future launches, not the startup-cached mode of a running
GUI. Do not launch a legacy writer while the service still owns its duties.
Close opened windows and remove only owned test entries through their maintained
teardown after confirmed exit/drain. If teardown is unavailable or uncertain,
preserve the main account's state, registration and frozen source and report the
blocker; never hand-delete units, markers, stores or a GUI copy. Do not stop
agents or unrelated services.

## Windows — va-kids

Use **CI-built Windows artifacts from the exact tested commit**, never Arch
binaries. Installed acceptance uses the owner's main interactive account and
canonical route, with no separate test account; keep staged artifacts in a unique
private folder on that account. Earlier component checks under other profiles
below retain their original scope and are not main-account acceptance. Close
opened windows and remove test registrations unless testing the final install.
Do not touch unrelated desktop/apps/settings.

### Recorded Windows registration subcheck — 2026-11-02

fixes-u reported one lifecycle case with eight real CLI invocations, using source
`e2c80a0e6f6ddff83e2ad48a59e8e7c9be0d263f`, CI run
[41359593881](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/actions/runs/41359593881), attempt 1,
job `125007003118`, artifact `13105895095` (`windows-shell-loader`). The staged
`cli/hgs.exe` was 50,289,152 bytes with SHA256
`013f899e4708b8a87f181b32486b3414c71f17501042bef148e29fc792aa6372`.
The retained report matches that source and binary identity.

The original console logon token had `effectiveAdministrator=false` and no
Administrators SID in its complete groups, including deny-only membership;
this was a standard user rather than an unelevated administrator. The task was
initially absent; install registered it in READY state, reinstall changed
neither registration nor the staged CLI, and removal restored absence.
fixes-u confirmed child waits, task/temporary launcher absence and removal of
the private test profile and stage; no native agents were touched.

The local enable marker remained absent. Final service status was not running,
with writers disabled, lifecycle unavailable, IPC not ready and no PID, epoch
or generation. This covers passive registration only. Login triggering, service
start/readiness, background work, presence, notifications and GUI remain pending.
The separate CI first-status 15-second timeout remains a failed CI result;
this PC subcheck does not make that workflow green.

### Recorded Windows frontend authentication subchecks — 2026-11-02

fleet-c supplied retained reports for source
`7c0c7c043c55d194bc66a897bf980228541eaa81`, CI run
[41375310707](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/actions/runs/41375310707), native job
`125054215361`, artifact `13111379237`. The recorded CI core suite passed 1213
tests with three existing ignored tests, and all six frontend cases passed;
the native job still failed the separate known 15-second registration-status
check. This is not an overall green CI result.

The exact artifact's private va-kids run used console session 1, native 64-bit
processes and a token reporting `effectiveAdministrator=false`. Its retained
report passes 11 process checks, six request-evidence checks and six frontend
cases. These cover same-user agent names/markers, stale birth/configuration/
fingerprint and over-limit environments. The canonical-pipe fixture uses the
production listener/cache and original-child runner: its positive case returns
`desktop_background_unavailable` with `accepted:false` after authentication;
negative cases return `frontend_authentication_refused`. Policy and writers
remain false in both service-status observations.

The caller/helper/SYSTEM ancestry reached a query-only access-denied boundary
(error 5); that does not prove a different SID, as clarified in #955. A separate
read-only native adapter probe admitted the genuine GUI after its original
launcher exited, while the original GUI remained live and responsive. It did
not issue a request or mutation permit for that GUI. The retained cleanup report
confirms child waits, an empty owned job, task absence and removal of 60 private
stage/profile entries; fleet-c reported original-child exit and final wait 0.

No additional standalone `.66.3.37` native adapter/evidence case is identified
by these reports and its current contract. The existing UI/durable-parity row
still needs the actual confirmed UI-to-ready-service commit/result round trip
under `.66.3.31/.32`; the authentication fixture stops before that effect.
Real logon, notifications, media, agent-preserving upgrades and whole UI parity
remain pending in their own rows. Packaging receipts are separate evidence.

The notification checks require the service's actual lifecycle/adapter wiring,
not only the merged ledger, discovery or host primitives. Exercise old unread
replies during first startup (no stale-notice burst), a new reply on a later
catalog page after focus expires, and a new reply during a policy baseline.
Record the accepted conservative first-baseline omission window from
[#914](https://github.com/ufna/zerus/pull/914); native presentation and click results
still need their own platform checks above.

## Deletion PR merge gate

The coordinator records per-platform acceptance and any exceptions against the
inventory; unmet G1–G5/G7 responsibilities remain blockers. The draft deletion PR
must be rebased on the final installer/consumer/notification/packaging PRs and pass
source/privacy, workflow/security, package and retained migration/updater tests.
Audit final artifacts for Qt/KF6/WebEngine requirements and dangling source paths.
Keep `hgs`, `HGS_*`, service/app IDs, installed paths, user data, migration readers,
CLI/connector/ConPTY and immutable published assets unchanged. Keep legacy update
feed fields and sealed-candidate retry templates while old clients require them.
Only then remove Qt build code, jobs, dependencies and the obsolete fallback
offer; the coordinator owns merge and rollout. This document authorizes no install,
service cutover, credential operation or deletion of user data.
