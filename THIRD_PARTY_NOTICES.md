# Third-party components

Zerus original source and artwork are licensed under the MIT license in `LICENSE`.
Dependency licenses and copyright notices remain in effect.

## Vendored code

`src/state/data/codex-0.160.1-greetings.txt` retains the finite native empty-state
greeting vocabulary from OpenAI Codex `rust-v0.160.1` for exact reset recognition.
`src/state/data/codex-empty-state-60x21.txt` retains its released settled idle-logo
glyphs, verified against 0.160.1, 0.162.0 and 0.162.1. Source provenance is recorded
in each file; the original Apache-2.0 license is
retained in `docs/licenses/codex-LICENSE.txt`, which is also shipped with packages.
No native Codex executable is bundled.

`tray/vendor/libvterm` contains libvterm 0.3.3 under MIT. Its original copyright
notice and complete license are retained in `tray/vendor/libvterm/LICENSE`;
source provenance and archive checksum are in `UPSTREAM.md` beside it.

`tray/vendor/md4c` contains the md4c 0.5.2 Markdown parser and entity table
under MIT. Its original license is retained in `tray/vendor/md4c/LICENSE.md`;
source provenance and archive checksum are in `UPSTREAM.md` beside it.

## GitHub logo

The About page uses the [GitHub mark from Primer Octicons](
https://github.com/primer/octicons/blob/97825f832c98f817867f770d084c08e3edc6f78c/icons/mark-github-16.svg). Its complete MIT license and GitHub copyright notice are retained
in `tray/resources/icons/github-mark.svg`, including the embedded Qt resource.

## Dependencies obtained during build

Rust dependencies and versions are locked in `Cargo.lock`. Their license
expressions and source repositories are recorded in `docs/rust-dependencies.json`.
This inventory is metadata, not a replacement for dependency license texts.
Cargo downloads the corresponding sources and license files from crates.io.

The GUI links Qt 6 (Widgets, Network and WebEngineWidgets), and on Linux the KDE
Frameworks KStatusNotifierItem and KWindowSystem. These retain their own licenses.
Qt WebEngine includes Chromium and additional third-party components. See the
[Qt WebEngine licensing documentation](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6.8/qtwebengine-licensing.html)
and the notices supplied by the exact Qt distribution used to build the application.

The Arch package links Qt/KDE dynamically and requires their system packages; it
does not bundle Qt, KDE or Chromium. Their distribution supplies their notices
and corresponding source. `scripts/collect-licenses.py` collects the exact
host-target Cargo dependency license texts and inventory into the package,
alongside the Zerus and vendored libvterm and md4c licenses. A missing dependency notice
fails packaging. Review notices and any source/relinking obligations again if
the linkage or bundled components change. MIT licensing of Zerus itself does
not relicense its dependencies.

The CLI's `rusqlite` build includes SQLite through `libsqlite3-sys`. The collected
notices also preserve its upstream public-domain dedication, separate from the
Rust binding's MIT notice. [SQLite copyright](https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html).

Native agent CLIs are installed separately by the user and are not included here.

## Android Markdown dependencies

The Android application bundles CommonMark Java 0.30.0 and its GFM tables,
strikethrough, task-list and autolink extensions under BSD-2-Clause, plus
autolink-java 0.12.0 under MIT. Both projects are maintained by Robin Stocker
and contributors. Their exact upstream license texts are retained in
`mobile/android/app/src/main/assets/licenses/commonmark-java.txt` and
`mobile/android/app/src/main/assets/licenses/autolink-java.txt` and shown in the
application's third-party notices. Sources: [CommonMark Java](
https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java/tree/commonmark-parent-0.30.0) and
[autolink-java](https://github.com/robinst/autolink-java/tree/autolink-0.12.0).
