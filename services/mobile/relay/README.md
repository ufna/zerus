# Rust relay runtime

`zerus-relay` is the standalone server for Zerus mobile API v1. It runs on Rust
1.85 or newer, Tokio, Axum/Hyper and SQLx. PostgreSQL serves multiple workers;
SQLite is an exclusive local backend. The production image contains the Rust
binary and its system libraries, without Python. The Python outbound connector
and installed Android clients use their existing protocol and credentials.

## Build and verify

From this directory:

```sh
cargo +1.85.0 build --release --locked
cargo +1.85.0 fmt --check
cargo +1.85.0 clippy --locked --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo +1.85.0 test --locked
```

The PostgreSQL contract is explicit, never silently treated as passed by a local
SQLite run. Point `ZERUS_RELAY_TEST_DATABASE_URL` at a **disposable** PostgreSQL
instance whose fixture role may create databases. The test creates and removes
a uniquely named database; credentials are not logged:

```sh
cargo +1.85.0 test --locked --test contracts postgres_cross_worker -- --ignored
```

From the repository root, with the `services/mobile` test dependencies installed:

```sh
export ZERUS_RELAY_BINARY="$PWD/services/mobile/relay/target/debug/zerus-relay"
export PATH="$PWD/services/mobile/relay/target/debug:$PATH"
python -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -p test_rust_relay.py -v
python -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -p 'test*end_to_end.py' -v
python -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -p test_peer_migration.py -v
```

These replay the released Python HTTP assertions against a Rust process and
exercise the actual Python connector with synthetic native subprocesses. They
include persisted Python receipts, exact canonical hashes, Unicode, attachments,
one-hop routing and cancellation. The full reference/connector suite remains
`python -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -v`. The reference Python
HTTP module is retained as an independent compatibility oracle, not selected by
the supported server CLI. `zerus-mobile` delegates administration/serving to
`zerus-relay`; the offline `migrate-sqlite` utility remains Python.

## Boundaries

- `http.rs` owns authentication before ingestion, separate anonymous,
  authenticated and long-poll admission, trusted proxy parsing, request/body
  deadlines, disconnect cleanup and bounded response spools.
- `protocol.rs` validates exact operation envelopes and native identities.
  Attachment validation decodes into one reusable 48 KiB buffer. The relay never
  executes native commands or follows paths supplied by a phone.
- `json.rs` bounds depth and lexical structure before object materialization.
  Canonical ASCII escaping, key ordering, arbitrary integer precision and Python
  float formatting preserve API v1 request identities. A deterministic 20,000
  float differential test compares the independent Python encoder. Containers
  are decoded from borrowed raw JSON so the legal object key
  `$serde_json::private::Number` cannot be interpreted as serializer metadata.
  Legacy Python receipt tests cover this key as well as Unicode and large numbers.
- `store/requests.rs` owns queue admission, result reservations, committed claims,
  receipts, expiry and permanent mutation identity tombstones. A prepared
  submission owns one canonical payload plus small typed metadata; SQL work does
  not retain its decoded attachment tree. Claim payloads leave storage only
  after commit. No error path changes `claimed` back to `queued`.
- `db.rs` supplies bounded pool acquisition and one transaction implementation
  for both SQL dialects. PostgreSQL workers share the existing schema and quota
  allocation. PostgreSQL network buffers are shrunk before connections return to
  the pool, preventing the largest transferred payload from remaining allocated
  on every pooled socket. SQLite uses a private file, an exclusive process lock, one
  connection and SQLx's database worker thread. Dropping a transaction rolls it
  back; cancelling a response never retries an external operation.
- `registry.rs` binds physical computers, aliases and immutable one-hop routes.
  Catalog size is checked before fetching selected payloads, then fetched in a
  batch. A withdrawn or revoked route fails queued requests and makes claimed
  requests uncertain. It never reroutes a claimed request.
- `store/snapshots.rs` separates liveness and event-free snapshot changes from
  shared payload accounting. Event publication and wake jobs have transactional
  caps. Lock order is global event accounting, payload shard when needed,
  workspace, credential, then route/request; multi-workspace locks are sorted.
- `store/background.rs` owns bounded indexed maintenance batches and durable
  poll/push leases. PostgreSQL advisory locks elect maintenance transactions;
  PostgreSQL startup never retires another worker's claims.
- `push.rs` sends generic wake hints through UnifiedPush or FCM HTTP v1. Provider
  requests run outside transactions. UnifiedPush requires an exact operator
  host allowlist, public DNS addresses pinned through TLS, and no redirects or
  environment proxy. FCM uses short-lived service-account OAuth tokens and an
  RS256 signature from `ring`; tokens/endpoints/provider errors are never logged.

Idle polls hold no query-pool connection. Each PostgreSQL worker has one dedicated
LISTEN connection and a bounded local broadcast channel; notifications contain
IDs only. Polls subscribe before querying, recheck authorization on each wake and
fall back to durable reads every five seconds. Listener reconnect wakes waiters.
A notification is a hint, never proof of delivery.

## Resource ownership

Defaults retain the existing 29 MiB inline-request and 1 MiB ordinary-response
limits, one large payload lane, 8 MiB of aggregate small request bodies and eight
small response slots. Parsing/encoding work runs on a bounded blocking executor;
its ownership guard retains admission even if the HTTP future is cancelled.
The canonical encoder preallocates its exact output size rather than doubling
large buffers for final delimiters. Responses use immediately unlinked files
with 64 MiB total reservation per worker and a 32 MiB maximum claim reservation.
Keep `TMPDIR` on a private disk-backed spool, as in Compose. The Debian image
also fixes glibc's arena count and mmap/trim thresholds (`MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=2`,
`MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD_=131072`, `MALLOC_TRIM_THRESHOLD_=131072`): deallocated
maximum payloads must return to the OS instead of accumulating in allocator
arenas between tasks. Apply the same environment before starting a glibc binary
outside Docker when reproducing its memory measurements.

Long polls have separate local and durable quotas (256 per worker, two per
credential, 32 per workspace). Cancellation transfers the local permit to a
tracked lease-cleanup task until SQL cleanup finishes. Failed cleanup also has a
durable expiry. Ordinary requests cannot consume that reserved cleanup capacity.

The server bounds accepted TCP connections (default 1024), headers (100 and a
32 KiB buffer), header ingestion (10 seconds) and connection lifetime (120 seconds).
Connections closing at their lifetime ceiling are normal: clients retry reads,
while mutation receipt recovery uses the original UUID. There are two async
runtime threads per process. Worker overload returns 429 and `Retry-After: 1`.
Health is independent of SQL/admission; readiness coalesces a two-second probe
and caches its result for one second. Errors omit SQL, bodies, tokens and URLs.

SIGINT/SIGTERM stops accepting connections, wakes idle polls, drains tracked
work and closes pools. Final database cleanup has a five-second deadline so an
unresponsive database cannot prevent process exit; durable leases then expire.
Compose allows 45 seconds. Command claims committed before
a shutdown retain their normal deadlines and can become uncertain; restarting a
worker never makes those commands executable again.

## Upgrade and operation

The listener, API, private JSON configuration, database tables, IDs, token hashes,
pairing invitations, event cursors and connector journal bindings are preserved.
The default state path remains `~/.local/share/zerus-mobile/relay.sqlite3`.
PostgreSQL workers must use identical pool/quota settings, including allocation
shard count; mismatched allocation is refused. Local administration stays CLI
only. The image also supplies `zerus-mobile` as a binary alias.

An existing PostgreSQL installation needs a runtime replacement, not a data
export or identity reprovisioning. Before an owner-authorized cutover, verify a
backup restore, drain ingress and stop only the old relay workers. Start the Rust
workers against the same authoritative database and existing configuration;
verify readiness, a synthetic request/receipt and revocation. Keep native agents,
connectors, tmux and DeepSeek hosts running. A Rust-to-Python rollback must use the
same current database, never a snapshot predating newly accepted receipts.

Stop the sole SQLite server before local administration or a runtime replacement;
Rust refuses a second owner of that file. Never run Python and Rust SQLite
writers simultaneously. SQLite-to-PostgreSQL is a distinct offline migration,
using the preserved utility and verification procedure in the parent README.
The Python historical service remains available to tests through `create_app`,
but normal CLI/server packaging always selects Rust.

Production deployment requires separate owner authorization. Repository tests
and a built image do not establish a live cutover. FCM delivery to a real device
requires operator credentials and a device; local tests do not claim that result.

## Capacity evidence

Run `tests/load.py` through the repository's Python test environment after building
`services/mobile/Dockerfile`. It creates only disposable containers and volumes,
with a 256 MiB memory/swap ceiling, no capabilities, a read-only image and a
private disk-backed spool. Repeated maximum attachments and late syntax failures
exercise warm allocations, committed claims, results and cleanup. Inspect both
RSS and cgroup memory, since SQLite page cache and spool writes also count.

Use `--backend postgres` to create a private disposable PostgreSQL 17.11 container
and exercise the production SQL path. The harness suspends that database,
checks independent health and failed readiness, resumes it and verifies recovery
and delivery of the queued commands. It also checks graceful process exit while
the database is suspended again. PostgreSQL is measured separately from the
relay worker's cgroup. The SQL contract also terminates only its own LISTEN
sockets and checks reconnect wakeups and durable visibility across workers.

Local Linux x86_64 qualification on 2026-10-10, Rust 1.85 release image, default
limits, disk-backed spools, 256 MiB worker memory/swap limit:

| Backend and profile | Upload outcomes | Peak RSS MiB | Peak cgroup MiB | Resting RSS MiB | Health p99 ms |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| PostgreSQL, five maximum Unicode/attachment uploads, database outage/recovery | 3 accepted, 2 quota refusals | 139.30 | 137.18 | 9.79 | 29.28 |
| SQLite, five maximum Unicode/attachment uploads | 3 accepted, 2 quota refusals | 117.57 | 222.66 | 13.34 | 31.71 |
| SQLite, two simultaneous maximum uploads, twice | 2 accepted, 2 admission refusals | 117.51 | 195.82 | 13.52 | 46.31 |
| SQLite, five maximum bodies with late syntax errors | 5 rejected with 400 | 36.79 | 30.57 | 11.33 | 1.27 |
| SQLite, five dense JSON bodies | 5 rejected with 413 | 36.90 | 33.44 | 11.20 | 1.70 |

All profiles reported zero OOM kills. Every accepted request was claimed once,
completed and recovered by its receipt. The harness also requires resting RSS
below 64 MiB to catch retained payload/driver allocations. Health samples are
local observations during these short probes, not a latency SLO or a throughput
benchmark; RSS and cgroup accounting include different kinds of memory.

Historical Python measurements are in `docs/relay-architecture.md`. This Rust
migration does not certify the 10,000-computer/50,000-phone planning target.
Measure sustained metadata/heartbeat rates, notification fanout, PostgreSQL WAL,
autovacuum, storage and pool saturation before changing deployment limits.
