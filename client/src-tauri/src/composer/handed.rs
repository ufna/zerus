//! A Send handed to the desktop service (zerus-5wmh.66.4.4, slice 3, the
//! deferred_send kind): the route of the one original and the read-only
//! checks of its result.
//!
//! Only the Send action that reserved and durably saved the checkpoint
//! offers its original ([`Composers::offer`]). A reload or a reopened session
//! never offers anything: it only looks the held identity up. While the
//! service still reports the original in progress, the draft stays uncertain
//! without Allow retry, shows [`STILL_SENDING`] as a normal status and is
//! checked again with a bounded back-off, only while its session is open and
//! the window is shown. A settled result ends it as the direct path would:
//! Recorded clears the draft, a child that never started releases its
//! identity, and Unknown stays uncertain for Allow retry. A service that
//! cannot be read leaves it uncertain with Allow retry.
//!
//! A "Compact and continue" the service takes (zerus-5wmh.66.4.8, the
//! compact_to_send kind) is handed over the same way from its compaction's
//! call ([`Composers::hand_compaction`]): from the moment its offer is
//! written, the draft is a delivery of that message held by the service,
//! shown with [`STILL_SENDING`] and a locked Cancel send, and its result ends
//! it as a handed send's would.
//!
//! A "Resume and send" of a stopped Claude, Kimi or Codex session the
//! service takes (zerus-5wmh.66.4.9 and .10, the session_resume kind) is
//! handed over the same way from its start's call
//! ([`Composers::hand_start`]). A fresh start and a resume with compaction
//! stay direct, and so does a Codex session for a service that does not
//! observe its resumed agent.
