//! Automatic recovery's shared policy (`zerus_client_core::recovery_settings`):
//! a background service, as Qt's RecoverySync is. Once a second it follows
//! this computer's machine card and the peers; every 15 seconds, as Qt's
//! timer, it reads every machine. Nothing is read or written before the card
//! says whether this computer runs agents (or, without one for 30 s, Qt's
//! default that it does), and a replay never drives the CLI. The newest
//! policy is copied to machines behind it; each answer sends
//! `recovery-changed` with the page's view. Calls run on their own threads.
