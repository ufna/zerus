//! The voice composer, ported from the Qt client's `SpeechComposer`: record
//! a voice (or round video) message, keep it as a durable draft, choose the
//! speech provider, preview, send it once, and recover an interrupted or
//! refused send without ever sending the audio twice on its own. In a draft
//! composer (dictation) the recording is transcribed into the draft instead.
//!
//! The composer does no I/O and shows nothing. Each input returns
//! [`Effect`]s; the caller carries them out off the UI thread and answers
//! with the effect's token: [`Effect::Load`] and [`Effect::Save`] through
//! S5's draft store ([`crate::drafts`], durable saves),
//! [`Effect::Call`] with [`run_call`], [`Effect::Insert`] through the
//! composer's draft, and [`Effect::Ask`] with a confirmation. [`shown`]
//! gives what the controls show.
//!
//! What is written when: the recording as soon as it stops; the submit's
//! request ID (`submitted`) before the audio is sent; a refusal when it
//! arrives; and an empty draft once the message is accepted or discarded.
//! The draft key is `voice-message-draft\n{session key}`.
//!
//! Reference: `tray/src/speech/SpeechComposer.cpp`, `SpeechClient.cpp`.
