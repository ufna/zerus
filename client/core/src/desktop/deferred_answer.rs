//! Exact input for the service-owned deferred answer (zerus-5wmh.66.4.7,
//! slice 3, its second kind): one original `hgs answer <session> --json` with
//! the exact stdin the client built for the deferred-input checkpoint it
//! reserved and saved with the question card, then only scoped reads of its
//! result. The result is reconciled from the CLI's own `question_receipts`
//! record of that request ID, never from the child's exit or its reply.
//!
//! The intent carries the question's consent identity as the person saw it
//! at the click (`pinned`, the closed [`CONSENT_FIELDS`] projection), and the
//! checkpoint binds its hash. The actor compares it again, before its child,
//! with the native current question read from the original store; that
//! fresh observation, never `pinned`, decides source and transport.
//!
//! These closed values carry no current writer, frontend, profile, exclusion
//! or execution authority: only the same current native action that durably
//! reserves the checkpoint supplies a one-shot admission. An imported,
//! recovered, reconnected or offered-Unknown original gets the read-only
//! lookup only. No answer is ever synthesized, and nothing here is a
//! standing approval.
