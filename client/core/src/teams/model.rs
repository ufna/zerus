//! What the Teams views follow, which read is due, and the view each reply
//! gives. Pure and clock-driven, so tests replay replies without `hgs`.
//!
//! A follow names the team list, what waits for the person and at most one
//! watched team: a team tab follows one team, and following another ends the
//! first. A followed read runs every [`POLL`] while the tab is visible; a
//! hidden tab reads nothing. The view is read again after the desktop's own
//! action ([`TeamsModel::refresh`]) and when the project's tasks topic changed
//! ([`TeamsModel::tasks_changed`]); a change that arrives while its read is in
//! flight is not lost: it marks the slot and the slot is read again at once
//! when the reply lands.
//!
//! A reply becomes an update only when the view it projects differs from the
//! last one sent for that key, so an unchanged team costs a read and nothing
//! more. Keys: `list`, `waiting` and `team:<id>`. One page is kept per key; a
//! page of a key is read on request with [`TeamsModel::page`] and replaces the
//! shown page, and the projected view names the next page's cursor.
