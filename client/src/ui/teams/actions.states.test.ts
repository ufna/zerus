// (not admitted), hold (not held), release (held); decisions.rs accept
// (reported), return (reported, with a holder), cancel (any); members.rs pause
// (active), resume (paused, with a session), stop (active or paused), archive
// (not removed, not the lead). Task and member actions need an active team and
