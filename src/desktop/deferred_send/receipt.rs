//! The read-only observation of one original's own CLI input receipt
//! (zerus-5wmh.66.4.4, slice 3, G1 condition 2), from the original receipt
//! store only.
//!
//! `hgs send` writes `input_receipts/<request_id>.json` under the CLI's state
//! root, atomically: `in_progress` before the first input byte reaches the
//! terminal, then `submitted` after its Enter. Only an exact `submitted`
//! receipt of this original is a submission; it still proves nothing about
//! whether the agent read the message.
//!
//! The store is held and read through [`crate::desktop::original_store`]:
//! the state root and this kind's folder are opened before the original
//! child exists, and the receipt is read after the physical drain from those
//! exact objects ([`read`]). Every other observation is Unknown and never
//! authorizes a resend: `in_progress`, a missing, corrupt, oversized, unsafe,
//! replaced, changing or mismatched receipt, folder or root.
