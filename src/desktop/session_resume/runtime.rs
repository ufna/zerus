//! One fixed local resume-then-send executor (zerus-5wmh.66.4.9, slice 3),
//! independent of the UI lifetime. Native admission, each original child and
//! its resource drain are separate; only the drain, through the CLI's own
//! receipt, settles a child. After a resume its own exact receipt recorded,
//! the same live operation waits, off the actor and within one never-renewed
//! budget, for the resumed run's record to show its agent takes a message,
//! and only then prepares, reserves and spawns the send bound to that run. A
//! resumed Codex shows that only on its terminal: the send's own
//! effect-free observation child decides it, in each read of the wait and
//! once more right before the send's spawn turn (zerus-5wmh.66.4.10). A
//! restart never resumes a wait.
// Only the Linux runner starts an original child; macOS refuses every
// original at admission.
