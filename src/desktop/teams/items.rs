//! Named non-fatal conditions of the team service that have no card: a
//! stopped or archived team's cancel that keeps failing or has halted, a stop
//! cleanup whose key clears keep getting no answer, the terminal page's
//! fault. A live team's failing work has its card, and is never listed here.
//!
//! Each item mirrors one durable row of the service and is written and
//! cleared by that row's writer, in the transaction that writes or ends the
//! row; the service's bounded cleanup pass removes an item whose row is gone.
//! `hgs team status` reads one page of a team's items and the service-wide
//! ones read-only, with a capped count of the rest, and decides whether each
//! is current: the service records only when it last tried and when it tries
//! next.
