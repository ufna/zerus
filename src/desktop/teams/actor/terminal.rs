//! A member whose terminal holds input (zerus-63rru.79). The task command
//! refuses a hand-out before any key when the member's terminal is not at an
//! empty agent prompt (a question, a dialog or an unsent draft), and says so
//! by a typed cause. That is not a failed hand-out but a fact about the
//! member: its terminal is not free. It is kept under `terminal:<member>` in
//! this actor's ledger, one row per member, with the stamp of the member's
//! fleet row when the refusal was observed.
//!
//! While it stands the member is not free for the selection, so the next pass
//! offers the task to another free member, and a ready task that only this
//! member can take gets zerus-63rru.55's card after its period. It ends when
//! the member's row changes, or once the retry table's delay for its refusals
//! has passed (1, 2, 4, 8, then 15 minutes): a member whose row never shows the
//! question is then tried again, not on every pass, and a further refusal
//! waits longer. A delivery submitted to the member ends it.
