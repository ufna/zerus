//! The member's doorbell: one guarded send that says how many of the lead's
//! answers wait and names `hgs team current`. It never carries the text of a
//! question or of an answer; the member's own read shows them. The same
//! rules as the lead's doorbell, per member: the team running, the member's
//! session live and idle with no pending request, a mark newer than the
//! binding's last doorbell, the interval passed, and at the spawn the member
//! still holding the attempt the mark names.
