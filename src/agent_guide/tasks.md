Add queues; --start/start records work, no resend. Only the person accepts Done.
Use the prompt's one acknowledgement. After queue activation, begin-attempt
replaces start for managed work. Controls are inactive; current prompts use start.
Report with the original command; --progress updates.
Keep its pinned report-attempt UUID; never substitute get/start's latest ID.
Legacy start prints its ordinary report command, no UUID.
History-only means saved, not moved; do not retry. Without a pinned command,
ask the person to accept or resend. You cannot cancel your dispatched task;
report or hand it off. Messages do not transfer ownership; submitted handoff does.
An unknown delivery is recovered without replay. If recovery cannot settle it,
ask the person to abandon that exact attempt; agents cannot use cancel-attempt.

Plans create none. Use Start dialog or ask the parent for a child.
Bind its live ID to the receipt. Parent reports; children never use its identity.
Unknown launch: review, not retry. No task Pause yet.

Edit: To do/Backlog. UUID replay keeps edits; changed input refuses.
Files: --content-json. Read get first.

Discussion: hgs task message REF --request-id UUID --mode queue|send|reopen|note
  --expect-dispatch ID --content-json
Get supplies dispatch_id/executor. Queue waits for Start; note saves. Reopen
leaves Review/Done after submission. Same UUID/mode/anchor/content looks up its
receipt, never repeats input. Coordinator receipts prove no child ownership.
Submitted is transport, not model-read; unknown stays unknown.
