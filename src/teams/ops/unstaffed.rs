//! A ready node that no member can take (zerus-63rru.45). The plan kernel
//! names these nodes (`ready::unstaffed`); the lead is told once per
//! episode, which is a node, its generation and the kernel's reason.
//!
//! The service's hand-out pass compares the kernel's set, over its uncooled
//! readiness view, with the told items through [`unstaffed_changes`], and
//! asks for `ReconcileUnstaffed` only when that finds a change. The store
//! never takes the service's list: it recomputes the set from its own
//! readiness view, members and open effects through [`unstaffed_of`] and
//! applies the changes of the same function in one operation. An episode
//! ends when its node leaves the set or its reason or generation changes,
//! and only the reconcile ends it: it closes the item with a reply that says
//! why (see `store::unstaffed`). The lead closing its item ends nothing and
//! is not told again. An unstaffed stage is retired and its parent handed to
//! the lead with the kernel's reason, as at the stage's creation.
