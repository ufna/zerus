//! The store follows the task's attempts. An attempt is named by the pair
//! of its generation and its ID: the current attempt can change while the
//! highest generation stays. When an observation shows an active task whose
//! current attempt is not the one the store holds and is not an effect of
//! the node, a person started a new execution between two observations, and
//! the store does at once what the two observations it missed would have
//! done in turn: the end of the earlier attempt, then the person's restore.
//! The node's own hand-out or reopen is never such an attempt, whether or not
//! its outcome is recorded, also when it comes back as current after a newer
//! attempt never started. A conflict, two attempts claiming the highest
//! generation, is its own flag: it is recorded as it came (the number, an
//! empty ID, the flag) and decides nothing while the task runs or waits.
//! The store remembers the attempt its node runs under, and that memory
//! changes only when the node takes an execution in: its own effect is
//! observed, a person's running execution is taken over or restored, or the
//! upgrade seeds it. An attempt merely observed while the task does not run
//! is not remembered, so that it is still judged when it starts.
