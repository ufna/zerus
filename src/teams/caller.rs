//! Interim caller proof shared by Teams and task intake. Both callers pass one
//! namespace admission first; then a marked caller must descend from its live
//! saved agent, and an unmarked caller is the person only after a complete,
//! bounded inspection finds no verified marked agent.
//!
//! The admission opens `/proc` and resolves `self/ns/user` from that
//! descriptor with `openat2` under `RESOLVE_NO_XDEV`: the lookup crosses no
//! mount and does not follow the last link, so a bind mount over the
//! process's own `ns` directory cannot answer for the real namespace. Any
//! failure refuses, including a kernel or sandbox without `openat2`; there is
//! no path fallback. A command in a sandbox with its own user namespace is
//! therefore refused for both marked and unmarked callers, so a lead or a
//! member whose shell runs in such a sandbox cannot use `hgs team`; those
//! team commands must run outside it. macOS has no namespaces and therefore
//! no admission. It withholds the environment of some programs, the system
//! shells among them; a tail with no byte other than NUL after the arguments
//! is read as withheld, never as empty, and the caller's own markers come
//! from the process itself. A person's command below a program that hides its
//! environment is refused with a sentence that names the Zerus window; a
//! marked command reads no ancestor's environment and is not affected.
//! `context` states what macOS withholds, which shapes pass, the limit at the
//! top and what a macOS sandbox can change. Other platforms refuse both
//! callers.
//!
//! This is not verified Person authority. A command whose ancestry does not
//! pass through readable same-user processes to its agent is outside this
//! rule: reparenting and credential-changing helpers can sever that chain. A
//! command that leaves its host's or agent's process tree (a double fork,
//! setsid, a background job whose shell exits) is adopted by the user's
//! service manager and passes as a person; with its own markers kept it is
//! refused plainly. This is the reparenting limit and it holds for every agent
//! kind.
//! Agents started without session markers are also undetectable, and the walk
//! refuses parent zero. A caller that replaces or instruments `hgs` itself or
//! writes the team store directly is outside this interim proof. Other
//! process boundaries still need the future verified Person authority.
//! Discovery uses ancestor environments, never a saved-session inventory;
//! only the few recorded resident hosts are listed, within their bound.
//! The top is established from process-table owners and parentage, never a
//! program name. A same-user parent of zero refuses. Only a verified foreign
//! parent ends the walk. Its top may have an unreadable environment; every node below
//! it must be inspected. An unreadable or credential-changing helper in the
//! middle still refuses; the message explains that process boundary without
//! assuming the person has left a terminal.
//!
//! Resident agent hosts serve several sessions from one long-lived process:
//! DeepSeek's host and OpenCode's shared service. No hosted session's own
//! agent is an ancestor of its shell, and a DeepSeek host passes the markers
//! of whichever session started it to every shell below it. So the person
//! path also refuses when an ancestor up to the top is a recorded live
//! resident host. A DeepSeek host is this computer's own record, matched by
//! process ID and birth like a recorded agent and never by a program name;
//! at most 64 host folders are read, and on macOS, where launchd adopts the
//! host as the top, no environment needs to be read. A host spawned by an
//! attempt that ended unconfirmed, before its running record, is also
//! recognized by its own exact host arguments beneath this state directory.
//! An unrecorded host with a different argument shape remains outside the check. OpenCode registers its
//! service only in its own file, read as untrusted data: the process it
//! names counts when that ancestor is not younger than the file, so the file
//! can only add a refusal. The check does not see a service that is not
//! registered there, a command it detaches, or an agent that changes its own
//! environment or the service file: one that points its state directory
//! elsewhere, or backdates, deletes or rewrites its own service file. OpenCode
//! is not covered against an agent that means to pass as a person. A host
//! record whose birth differs is not that host, and a record from another boot
//! names no process of this one. A missing state folder records no host. A
//! recorded ID without a birth, an unreadable or corrupt host record and more
//! host folders than the bound refuse.
//!
//! A marked DeepSeek claim (`dsh/...`) is proven by the hosted caller proof
//! and by nothing else (zerus-63rru.28): the host's per-call token names the
//! conversation whose tool call runs this command, the host's socket peer is
//! the recorded host and the host is an ancestor (`session_graph::
//! hosted_caller`). A proven claim is that session's key, `launch_id:` or
//! `run_id:` like any other agent's; a refusal carries the proof's own
//! sentence; an archived binding refuses; the ancestry proof is never tried
//! after it. A DeepSeek child agent's command is proven as its top-level
//! session and acts with that session's standing, as an in-process Claude or
//! Codex subagent does; a DeepSeek fork is its own session. Only a host that
//! advertises per-call tokens can prove anything; a host started before them
//! is never restarted or reloaded for it. A marked caller whose binding says
//! OpenCode's shared service serves its session is refused plainly: such a
//! session cannot be a team lead or member in this milestone, and
//! `host_served_agent` lets team creation and member launch refuse it too.
//! Any other marked claim below a recorded resident agent host is refused
//! with a sentence of its own: a command there can only be a session that
//! host serves, and only a DeepSeek claim's token proves one. The person path
//! and such a claim ask one check, [`hosted_ancestor`], which calls the shared
//! `state::dsh::hosted_ancestor`. It reads the bounded records, then the process
//! table alone and each ancestor's own argument vector, never `HGS_AGENT` or
//! another caller-set marker. Without records it still recognizes a live
//! host by its own exact arguments, but does not adopt walk refusals. With
//! records, an unreadable record or birth and a walk past its bound refuse
//! with the shared check's exact cause and recovery text. Deleting a host's
//! same-user records does not conceal an ancestor whose own arguments still
//! identify it; reparenting or a host with neither record nor matching argv
//! remains outside this interim proof. OpenCode keeps its separate service
//! file check described above.
//! [`limits`] is the one text that states every limit of these proofs.
//!
//! With a session-ID hint, ids/<ID>.json selects one verified record.
//! Without an index entry, fixed ID-layout and legacy-label paths are both
//! probed; disagreement refuses. Without a hint only the exact legacy name
//! route is used. One rename shadow is allowed; launch_label proves the old
//! name of a renamed ID record. No missing route is an absence proof: when no
//! record can be reached, or any identity contradicts the claim, admission
//! refuses. Only an established stale/archived/nonmatching process continues
//! the walk. No inventory scan, repair or compatibility fallback is used.
//! The walk is capped at 64 processes; environments and bindings at 1 MiB,
//! index entries at 4 KiB. No process environment is changed.
