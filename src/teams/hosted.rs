//! Whether the DeepSeek host of an agent home can serve Teams members
//! (zerus-63rru.28). The only advertisement is the host's own `ping`
//! answer (`callTokens`, `inputWitness`, `teamLifecycle`): its identity record holds no capability and the
//! adapter version did not change with the proof. So this asks the host the
//! way the hosted caller proof does, through the same reads: only a process
//! this boot's record names with its birth, still running with that birth,
//! through the socket whose peer is that very process, within one deadline.
//! A host started before the proof stays as it is; nothing here restarts,
//! reloads or signals a host, and no host is started to answer.
//!
//! Linux and macOS only, where DeepSeek hosts run.
