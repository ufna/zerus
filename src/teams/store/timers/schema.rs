//! This package's additions to a store. The extension knows two stores:
//! one from before it (no mark), which it extends to the current layout in
//! one immediate transaction (the tables, indexes and triggers first, then
//! the backfills, then the mark), and one at a layout that reached the
//! integration branch, which it steps forward to the current one. A mark
//! that only an unmerged development build could have written is refused
//! with a sentence that says so, and nothing is written; a newer mark is
//! refused as a newer schema is. Opening a store at the current layout
//! reads one row and takes no write lock.
//!
//! The one-time cost: the backfills walk the teams once and every archived
//! node once, in pages of 200 keys, under the write lock; memory stays one
//! page. Measured here at about 33 SQLite VM steps and 6 microseconds per
//! archived node (10,000 in 60 ms), so a million archived nodes hold the
//! lock for several seconds, once. Another process opening the store
//! meanwhile waits for it, up to a minute, instead of the usual two seconds.
