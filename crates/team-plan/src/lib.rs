//! Agent team types and the pure rules that decide what may run.
//!
//! A team is a lead session, member sessions with roles, and their work: a
//! plan of phases, a queue of tasks sent one by one, or both. A team task is a
//! Zerus task; this crate holds the structure a team adds around it.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a file, a clock or a session. Callers pass state in and
//! get decisions back, so every rule can be tested without a running agent.
//!
//! Agent Teams were designed and first built by WhiteWh in the `WhiteWh/zerus`
//! fork. See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-11-agent-teams-design.md`.
