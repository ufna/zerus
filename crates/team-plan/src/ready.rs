//! What may run now, and which member takes it.
//!
//! A node is ready when all of these hold:
//!
//! - it is Pending (its task is in To do) and not held;
//! - its phase exists, is not paused and is Approved, and a queue node is
//!   admitted;
//! - no planned phase before its own awaits acceptance;
//! - in a barrier phase, no planned phase before it has an undecided node;
//! - every hard dependency is Accepted and, in a team with an integration
//!   branch, integrated; every soft one is at least In progress; a cancelled
//!   one releases; a dependency missing from the view, listed twice in it,
//!   or naming a stage, holds;
//! - it is in no dependency cycle among the nodes that are not cancelled;
//! - no node In progress or Reported has a write set that overlaps its own;
//! - a stage checks a node that is Reported, in the stage's round, and
//!   listed once;
//! - its ID appears once in the view: a node listed twice is never handed
//!   out, since either row may be the stale one.
//!
//! "Before" follows the phases' display order: `order`, or the phase number
//! when `order` is unset. The queue is no planned phase: it neither waits
//! for one nor holds one.
