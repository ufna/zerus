# Contributing

Build requirements are documented in `docs/installation.md`. Keep fixtures synthetic and
machine connection settings local. `AGENTS.md` describes the Beads workflow.

## Proposals and repository labels

A feature PR is a proposal until maintainers accept its product scope. Before
adopting it, establish the use cases, configuration and lifecycle behavior, and
behavior on every supported platform. Optional third-party tools can be useful
extension proposals without belonging in the Zerus core. Deferring one does not
commit the project to implementing it or to a particular extension API.

Keep the existing `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation` and technical labels.
Use these additional labels to retain product decisions on issues and PRs:

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `proposal` | An idea whose product scope has not been accepted. |
| `deferred` | Retained for future consideration, without an active implementation or release commitment. |
| `extensions` | An optional third-party integration suited to a future plugin or extension. |
| `partially-adopted` | Part of a PR was adopted separately; the closing comment records what happened to the rest. |

Close deferred implementation PRs with a short explanation and retain their
labels, commits and discussion. Use `wontfix` for work the project does not plan
to take, rather than for an idea being kept for later. When a PR mixes a bug fix
and an unaccepted feature, investigate and take the fix separately with author
attribution; explain exactly what was adopted before closing the original PR.
Beads continues to own accepted implementation tasks and blockers.

To revisit retained ideas, search GitHub for
`is:pr is:closed label:proposal label:deferred`; add `label:extensions` to find
plugin candidates. Search `is:pr is:closed label:partially-adopted` to find PRs
whose fixes were taken separately.

## Local checks

```sh
python3 scripts/ci/check-source.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*publication.py'
bash scripts/ci/cli.sh
(cd client && npm ci && npm run check && npm test)
```

The CLI script clears inherited `HGS_*` session/account context, runs Rust unit
tests and terminal smoke tests, then runs the Python integration test classes in
parallel fresh processes and builds a release binary. Classes larger than twelve
tests run as several jobs unless they share a class fixture, slowest first by
the previous local run, or else by `scripts/ci/python-durations.json`.
`ZERUS_PYTHON_JOBS` bounds Python test parallelism; logs live under ignored
`artifacts/test-results/`. Zerus Next's Rust core and Tauri host have their own
manifests/locks and maintained `client-native-*` CI jobs. The Qt build/test tree
is retired; historical migration fixtures remain read-only compatibility data.
Zerus tracks the newest
stable Rust: `rust-version` and the toolchain pinned in CI follow the latest
stable release, and raising them is routine maintenance. Run
`cargo +1.99.1 test --locked` for that pinned toolchain.
The replica crate has its own lockfile: run
`cargo +1.99.1 test --locked --manifest-path crates/replica/Cargo.toml`; its
golden vectors must keep decoding, and `ZERUS_BLESS=1` only adds new ones.
The event stream's frame crate has one too: run
`cargo +1.99.1 test --locked --manifest-path crates/watch-protocol/Cargo.toml --target-dir target/watch-protocol`.

On Linux, the three worktree modules run through `scripts/ci/worktree-tests.py`
in a fresh PID/mount namespace, including their live process blockers and private
tmux servers. Production cleanup retains folders when a host process cannot be
inspected, so a shared host cannot establish the positive removal controls.
Local isolation requires `unshare` and `setpriv`; hosted disposable runners use
passwordless sudo only for namespace creation, then run fixtures as the original
user with no capabilities or supplementary groups. A real nondumpable child
checks that inspection restrictions still apply. Failed namespace admission fails
the tests without an uncontained retry. For a focused local run, use
`PYTHONPATH=tests python3 scripts/ci/worktree-tests.py test_worktrees test_worktree_lifecycle test_worktree_maintenance`.
On macOS these three complete modules run sequentially after the other Python
integration jobs. Exec/exit fixtures can briefly leave a live owned process
without readable BSD metadata, and production must retain folders in that case.
Disposable upstream GitHub macOS runners can also own protected service processes
whose metadata is permanently unreadable. `scripts/ci/macos-worktree-tests.py`
creates one locked, unprivileged temporary user for each complete module there.
The normal CLI, all fixtures, real process blockers and private tmux servers run
under that UID with a clean environment and private home. A kernel UID inventory
and real interpreter preflight establish this scope; no process is filtered from
an individual CLI call. After the tests, lingering fixture processes receive
TERM, then bounded KILL if necessary, as that unprivileged user with both real and
effective UID pinned and its directory-service identity rechecked before each
signal. The harness also closes only that private user's launchd domain, proven
absent before allocation, so per-user OS services stop respawning. The account is
removed only after the domain is absent, the UID inventory is empty and the
directory-service identity matches. Uncertain cleanup fails and retains the
scope for VM disposal. Owner Macs and other hosts refuse account creation before
allocation or sudo; local macOS checks continue under the current user. No test is
excluded and the production guard remains strict.

`check-source.py` checks portable syntax, privacy and release identities.
UI JSON and filesystem work belongs in bounded background Rust operations;
no new per-session UI worker/cache or blocking UI-thread parsing is allowed.

A change to tmux or `ps` call sites must keep Unix behaviour unchanged: compare a
[tmux census](docs/ci-and-aur.md#unix-tmux-census) of the branch with one of main.
`scripts/ci/check-windows-target.sh` type-checks the Windows target from Linux or
macOS.

On macOS the Rust standard library marks a child's pipes close-on-exec only after
creating them, so a child that another thread starts in between inherits them and
holds that exchange's input or output open until it exits. Where threads of one
`hgs` process can spawn at the same time (mobile peer discovery, speech computer
discovery), every such spawn goes through `platform::spawn_in_turn`.

The CLI script also builds `examples/fake_agent.rs`, a native stand-in agent for
terminal tests that need a real process rather than a script, such as those that
will run under the Windows session host. It records every input byte with its
framing (bracketed paste, ESC, Ctrl+C, Enter) and timing, renders fixture byte
streams, sets and resets terminal modes, sends terminal queries and records their
answers, runs hooks with agent-shaped JSON, writes its process ID, start time and
folder when ready, and follows a configured policy for signals and Windows console
events; its header lists the options and the record format. Linked or copied under
an agent's name, it takes its options from `FAKE_AGENT_*` variables and runs the
hooks in that agent's configuration. `tests/test_fake_agent.py` checks it under a
private tmux socket; `HGS_TEST_FAKE_AGENT` names another build.

`tests/test_backend_contract.py` uses it as `claude` for the
[terminal backend contract](docs/ci-and-aur.md#terminal-backend-contract): every
session operation a backend provides, driven and observed only through `hgs`
commands, their JSON and the agent's records. `HGS_TEST_BACKEND` selects `tmux`
(default on Linux and macOS) or `host` (the Windows session host, default on
Windows; see [testing the host](docs/windows-host-testing.md#the-terminal-backend-contract)).
A backend class there provides only its setup and teardown, `running()`,
`describe()`, `alive()` and attach client; extend the contract rather than the
backend classes when a behaviour must hold for both.

On Arch, `bash scripts/ci/arch.sh` also builds and validates the pacman package
as an unprivileged user. It substitutes a local Git source only in its disposable
build directory; it never installs the package or enables services.
Hosted Dev CI runs shared Rust/protocol checks, Linux CLI, Arch desktop/package,
macOS and Android on main. PRs retain Windows/iOS for affected or unknown paths;
Nightly and Stable require the full matrix. Manual runs default to all platforms,
with independent macOS-desktop and iOS flags. Validate workflow
edits locally before pushing. Daily nightlies publish a verified binary to GitHub and
AUR, and the Windows portable zip to GitHub, only after every check passes; stable
releases, which carry the zip their own candidate run tested, remain manually published.
See [CI and Arch publication](docs/ci-and-aur.md) for triggers and publication
requirements.

Native integration tests may need separately installed agent CLIs or a real desktop;
read each suite's setup before running it. Do not run tests against live agent state.
Some platform tests only exist on macOS, Linux or Windows. Record any unavailable
checks.

The OpenCode 2 native suite needs an installed OpenCode 2.0.32 or newer 2.x. Run it
locally on request; full Linux and macOS CI run it with the latest release. See
[OpenCode qualification](docs/opencode.md#qualification).

For the Rust mobile relay, run `cargo +1.99.1 test --locked` inside
`services/mobile/relay`. The Docker image uses that Rust binary. For the Rust
mobile connector, run `cargo +1.99.1 test --locked` inside
`services/mobile/connector`; [its README](services/mobile/connector/README.md)
names the variables its Python and `hgs` handoff tests need and how the
black-box suites run against its binary. For the Python connector and reference
compatibility fixtures, install `services/mobile` and
`services/mobile/tests/requirements.txt` in a Python 3.11+ virtual environment
and run `python -m unittest discover -s services/mobile/tests -v`.
The relay storage contracts and the connector HTTP suites need PostgreSQL:
without `ZERUS_RELAY_TEST_DATABASE_URL` the contracts use SQLite and the HTTP
suites skip instead of running the Rust relay. Start a disposable server with
one line:

```sh
docker run --rm -d --name zerus-relay-test-postgres -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust -p 127.0.0.1::5432 postgres:17.11-alpine -c max_connections=300
```

Then follow [the relay's PostgreSQL tests](services/mobile/relay/README.md#postgresql-tests)
for the variables and commands; each test creates and drops its own database.
These tests use synthetic subprocesses and isolated databases, without live native
agents. For Android, run `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest lintDebug assembleDebug` from
`mobile/android` with JDK 17 or 21 and Android SDK 36. Every CI run, PRs included,
also runs `testDebugUnitTest lintRelease` with `-PzerusFirebase=true` and a
synthetic `google-services.json`. Follow
[mobile setup](docs/mobile-deployment.md) for device and notification checks.

Beads issues, history and memories must contain only information suitable for public
source collaboration. An ignored local database still becomes remote data when
`bd dolt push` is run. Review the exported issues and memory before synchronizing.

Quick checks run Gitleaks with its default rules on the working tree and all Git
history of every push and pull request; findings are redacted from the public log
and `gitleaks:allow` comments do not hide them. `.gitleaksignore` exempts only two
reviewed immutable commit/path/rule/line fingerprints where the generic API-key
rule crosses adjacent synthetic session-name literals. The workflow security test
pins that exact list; new commits and all other findings still fail. Do not add
broad path, rule or value exclusions. For release preparation, also run
Gitleaks on the candidate source archive and Beads data, and review binary assets
and dependency notices. The local privacy script catches common accidental machine
paths and keys; it is not a complete secret scanner.

## Windows

Windows builds the [portable zip](docs/installation.md#windows): `hgs.exe`, whose
session host runs local sessions once they are enabled, and `hgs-tray.exe`.
You need:

- Visual Studio 2022 with the x64 C++ tools and Windows SDK;
- Rust for MSVC: stable, and the pinned 1.99.1 with clippy;
- Python 3.11 or later, Node/npm, Git for Windows with Git Bash, and 7-Zip;
- Evergreen WebView2 for interactive Zerus Next checks (no Qt SDK/runtime).

Clone with `git clone -c core.autocrlf=false`, as CI does: test fixtures and
scripts must keep LF line endings. Then, from Git Bash in the checkout:

```sh
cargo test --locked </dev/null

```

`tests/test_windows_client.py` runs `hgs.exe` against `examples/fake_ssh.rs`,
injected through `HGS_SSH`, with `HOME` and `USERPROFILE` in a temporary folder;
it never uses your SSH configuration and skips itself on other systems. The
native session host of Windows Phase 2 has its own isolated recipe and tests,
`tests/test_windows_host.py`, the bundled ConPTY tests in
`tests/test_windows_host_conpty.py`, the survival tests in
`tests/test_windows_host_survival.py` and the real-agent suites in
`tests/test_windows_native_agents.py`, which `scripts/ci/agent-compatibility.py`
runs with one latest Claude Code and Codex package per agent, each against a local fake
API: [testing the Windows session host](docs/windows-host-testing.md).

Kimi's optional native input, recovery, question and startup-trust fixtures are
`test_kimi_native.NativeKimi` (three cases),
`test_kimi_questions_native.NativeKimiQuestions` (three) and
`test_kimi_questions_native.NativeKimiTrust` (three). Run them only with an
privately selected `HGS_KIMI_TEST_BIN`, exact `HGS_KIMI_TEST_SHA256` and the runner's
sealed `HGS_KIMI_TEST_RECORD` plus official manifest, a sealed
`HGS_TEST_BIN`, private helper PATH and evidence directory; never point them at
the installed Kimi. Each case runs a private copy, disables automatic updates,
uses its loopback model and platform fixture, proves the child image and private
environment, and retains uncertain cleanup. The macOS cases compile one exec
shim per case, so they require both native and compiler resources. A current
latest-release campaign runs twelve native cases, including long Other answers,
explicit recovery of a retained editor, and preservation of a mismatching draft. Historical two-version receipts
do not define current selection. The seventeen R2 and seven question-fixture
controls use stand-ins and loopback
servers and establish fixture behavior only. `test_kimi_trust` and
`test_kimi_cache_hint` additionally execute hgs and private tmux fixtures; they
are synthetic integration tests, not pure controls. Historical native results
do not qualify a newly composed candidate.

The separate [latest Kimi native workflow](.github/workflows/kimi-native.yml)
runs these eight cases on disposable standard Linux and macOS runners for
relevant PR changes or a manual run. It builds hgs once with Rust 1.99.1 and
two jobs, runs the existing pinned tmux in a private prefix, resolves the official
latest release once and verifies its versioned manifest, exact target, bounded
size and SHA-256 before native
execution. It receives no provider or publication credentials, uses no cache,
and never installs Kimi globally. Linux x64 and Darwin arm64 are the only
reviewed images; an unexpected runner architecture fails before the build.
Every case keeps its existing image/environment/custody assertions. A timeout
or uncertain cleanup fails, retains the recorded private roots and images as
bounded diagnostics, and never claims that stopping the test leader stopped
its detached agents. Ephemeral VM disposal is the final boundary. Public model
endpoints are not configured; the fixtures' model and platform are loopback
only. This is not a kernel network enclosure or Windows Kimi qualification.
The historical NP50 owner-Mac campaigns are separate and are not replayed.
The [latest Kimi approval workflow](.github/workflows/kimi-approvals.yml) similarly
runs one selected release on macOS and Windows, including its existing Windows
environment preflight. Its native inventory is the unchanged seven exact Bash
approval cases plus exactly these four CreateGoal cases:
`test_goal_manual_starts_in_manual`,
`test_goal_yolo_auto_switches_to_never_ask`,
`test_goal_yolo_cancel_does_not_start`,
`test_goal_yolo_keeps_ask_when_needed`, and the single ExitPlanMode case
`test_plan_review_approve`. These workflows remain path-filtered PR/manual
qualifications; they do not add Kimi to every main run.
`scripts/fetch-conpty.py` downloads the ConPTY package pinned in
`packaging/windows/conpty.json` from nuget.org and writes only its checked
`conpty.dll` and `OpenConsole.exe`; `package-windows.py` puts them next to
`hgs.exe` and fetches them itself without `--conpty`. `package-windows.py` finds the app-local Visual C++ runtime with `vswhere`, and
`check-windows-portable.py --run --selftest` starts both executables from an
extracted copy with a minimal environment and enables local sessions in its
disposable profile, which must stage the pinned ConPTY pair. Interactive checks need a real desktop session and WebView2; private CLI/pipe
fixtures do not establish GUI/tray/notification acceptance.

Windows OpenSSH (`ssh.exe`) never exits after it has used a synchronous pipe for
one of its standard streams, the kind Rust's standard library, Python, PowerShell
and the GitHub Actions runner give a child. It also never ends a remote command's
input read from `NUL` or a non-empty file, and writes an output file from its
start, over what `>>` keeps. Tests and scripts therefore reach `ssh.exe` only
through `hgs.exe`, which gives it a console or overlapped pipes for every stream
that carries data. The fake client refuses a synchronous pipe, `NUL` or a
non-empty file as input (except for `-G`) and an output file that already holds
data (exit 254), so a regression fails the tests instead of hanging them. Git Bash
rewrites arguments that look like POSIX paths when it starts a Windows program: set
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` before passing remote paths such as `/workspace/orbit` to
`hgs.exe`. A check against a real peer is described in
[the real-peer smoke](docs/ci-and-aur.md#real-peer-smoke-on-a-windows-pc).
`tray/tools/export-windows-icon.py` (Pillow) regenerates the checked-in Windows icon
after artwork changes.

`test_windows_mobile_gateway.py` needs Git for Windows' `openssl` on PATH and
runs outside a job that forbids breakaway, as do the other session-host suites.
Before that fixture, the two `windows_management::tests` library cases exercise
actual management-lock contention and expiry, and the six `windows_gateway`
integration cases exercise private configuration, revision admission, ACLs and
independent ownership of temporary fixture roots.
They must execute on Windows; Linux excludes them and is not runtime evidence.
It creates only a throwaway profile, tracked fake Codex session, copied gateway
bundle and HTTPS loopback protocol fixture. It checks actual connector Start,
duplicate Start, published capabilities, Terminal snapshot/input and duplicate
receipts, phone-list/invitation APIs, graceful Stop and the same surviving native
host/session. Startup custody is reserved before Start, including failed or
timed-out launches. Recovery verifies the private revision/generation/control
and unique copied process image, pins a Windows process handle and rechecks
control. Cleanup requires confirmed handle exit; an unknown final wait retains
the private root and fails the gate. Forced termination is limited to that owned
handle and also fails the graceful-stop gate. The separate `--custody-only`
launcher forbids executable-pattern cleanup and retains unknown timeout state;
there is no PID/tree fallback for the connector. It does not install
into an owner profile, contact a production relay or pair a real phone. Run the
production relay's existing contract suites separately. A skipped or unavailable
Windows suite is not evidence of supported runtime behavior.
